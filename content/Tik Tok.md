# TikTok

## Some context 

**⇒ The success of TikTok within the United States**
- Created in 2017 for its international version 
- Now, the App has over 150 million American users (especially teenagers)
- Americans spend an average of 56 minutes a day on TikTok 

**⇒ Since its massive success in the country, a bipartisan hostility towards the App suspected of being China’s Trojan Horse**
- Indeed, though it is based in Singapore and LA, TikTok is owned by the Chinese group ByteDance 
- **2020** : Trump tried and failed to force ByteDance to sell TikTok’s American business to a domestic owner 
- Many limited bans are already in place for instance on government devices
- **March 2023** : Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s chief executive was hauled before Congress. A Republican congresswoman declared : « Your platform should be banned »

**⇒ TikTok’s proposals**
- TikTok has denied that the Chinese government wields any influence over it
- It also proposed to Oracle, an American software giant, to relocate the data of American users and to inspect its source code

**⇒ Congress TikTok ban bill is now in the hands of the Senate**
- **March 2024** ! Eventually, it appeared that it was not sufficient and Congress passed a bill imposing TikTok to sell its American branch outside China. If China refuses, the app will be ban in the country. Now, the bill is in the hands of the Senate and China already claimed that it would oppose a sale. 

## Why being afraid of TikTok as China’s Trojan Horse ? 

**⇒ The issue of data = the fear that China could spy Americans thanks to the data collected**
- Partly, an exaggerated issue 
- No evidence than the App takes more than it claims (or more than its American rivals)
- The US has a lax data-protection legislation. Hence, China could just buy these datas from American companies 

**⇒ The issue of information = the fear that TikTok’s algorithm spreads misinformation or propaganda for the CCP**
- Real issue because a third of American adults under 30 consider TikTok a source not just of entertainment but of news. And TikTok’s popularity among teenagers makes concerns over user safety even more acute. 
- Given that TikTok is then a media, a paradox appears. Indeed, most countries place some restrictions on foreign ownership of old media like press or TV but not yet on social media. That is why some politicians argue that the influential platform should be separated from a country as ideological as China. 
- But here again, difficult to prove anything because it is impossible to know whether TikTok’s algorithm is responding to users’ preferences (effect of homophilia) or to manipulation from Beijing. <u>Ex</u> : TikTok was blamed for a potential bias in its treatment of what is happening in Gaza. If it is known that China supports Palestine we also know that America’s youth protested against Israel interventions. 

**⇒ The issue of technology and China’s refusal to sell TikTok**
- Since 2023, China said it would oppose a sale 
- As the artificial-intelligence race heats up, Xi Jinping clearly wants to preserve China’s advance on these technologies 
- But China has also to understand that if the bill is voted by the Senate, other Chinese apps popular in America will be banned like its e-commerce apps (Shein, Temu). 

**⇒ Bipartisan hostility** : 
- Dem = denouncing monopolies 
- Rep = denouncing a liberal bias 

**⇒ Social media are moving towards a model with professionals/consumers** (we are moving away from social media…)

Under Xi Jinping the autonomy of Chinese business has decreased… 

**⇒ The bill** : 
- TikTok US → US company (expensive, affordable only for Meta or X but anti-trust legislation…) 
- Or ban TikTok 

**⇒ Fear of foreign interference** 
- Existing laws for classic media <u>Ex</u> : Rupert MURDOCH became American before buying Fox News 
- Problem : not necessarily obvious 
	- Tricky to show that a bias is systematic (everybody does not see the same content)
	- Chicken-and-egg problem : if bias, what source ? (user preferences or algorithm)
- Elections are won thanks to few vote ⇒ higher the risk 
- Just being able to make America wonder about the legitimacy of its president is a victory 

**2016 and 2020** : Russia interfered in America’s presidential elections to support TRUMP. But it did not work in 2020… 

**Hybrid warfare** (<u>Ex</u> : Russia with Crimea) = the grey area between invading a country and be in peace with it <u>Ex</u> : misinformation, foreign agents within the country, mercenaries ⇒ enormous advantages = deniable (not me !) + cheaper 

**⇒ A world increasingly conflictual = shock for the West**
- **2001** : China joined the WTO ⇒ ok it will democratise itself ! Did not happen (richer, middle class but ∅ democracy)

**⇒ But it is not the cold war II**
- **URSS = economic power –** (no connections with the free world) **and military power +** 
- **China = economic power +** (with connections around the world and also in the USA) **and military power –** ⇒ the USA wanting more decoupling between its economy and China’s economy (policy started under TRUMP and perfect continuity with BIDEN)

**Microchips are mad in Taïwan** = enormously capitalistic industry (natural monopoly). But China might invaded Taïwan…Problem because the army needs microchips ⇒ BIDEN announced the creation of a microchip factory in the country. 

**2017 → 2023**
- US imports : ⅓ = Chinese (2017)
- US imports : 14% = Chinese (now)
- But to avoid tarifs China exports goods to other countries and then those countries exports the same goods to the USA ⇒ underestimation of the %  

**⇒ The lessons of the war in Ukraine concerning the possibility of a war in Taïwan**
- Some analyst consider that Russia’s difficulties to invade Ukraine might discourage China to invade Taïwan. But the war in Ukraine also revealed two weaknesses of the West : 
	- « The global South » did not vote for UN’s resolutions condemning Russia 
	- West (US) : economic sanction ⇒ less likely to happen

- to defuse a threat = désamorcer un problème 
- decoupling 
- flash point = point d’ignition, déclencheur
