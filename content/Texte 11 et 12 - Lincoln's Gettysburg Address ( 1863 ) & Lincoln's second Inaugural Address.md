## The Gettysburg Address ( 1863 )

Speech given at the end of the battle of Gettysburg ( july 1863 ) = victory for the north. But extremely deadly battle ( ≈ 30k casualties on both side ). 

Preserving the Union is presented in a similar way as defending the values of freedom against tyranny. This war is a trial sent by God to test the United State. The term slavery is not mentioned. The war is evoked in political terms. Abstract conception of war as a source of liberty. 

cf. Stephen Crane, *The red Badge of Courage* 

## Second Inaugural Address 

Lincoln reelected in a period of defeats for the South. The Southern capital Richmond Virginia was about to be invaded. Republican party divided between peace and eradication of Southern troops. Lincoln, moderate, wants the North to have a clear victory but he does not think that destroying the enemy is a good idea. It will be time to think about reconstruction and reunification.
