# Affirmative action 
***
**Affirmative action** = set of policies seeking to benefit to a particular group historically discriminated (used in universities’ admissions policies). In US but also in NZ or Canada. Origin in the 1960s during the Civil Rights movement and under KENNEDY. 

The **SATs** = test to enter in the university (<u>Ex</U> : Michigan)
- White → > 600 points 
- Black → > 400 points 
- Asian → > 800 points 

It is a **blunt tool because it considers that all black for instance are working class. 

**2023 : Students for Fair Admission v. Harvard** = U turn but not really chocking among popular opinion (≠ abortion’s U turn) because affirmative action is really controversial (California, a progressive state, is against). 

Americans consider that racial minorities matter a lot (≠France). But no scientific conception of race…So how could you have a policy based on race ? Hispanics are not a race according to US’s list. Why ? The Mexican Cession of **1848** (treaty stated that Mexican would have full rights as citizens). The Mexican government refused separate race. Principal of **self-identification** ⇒ you can pretend to be black. 

**But sometimes it is more complicated and related to familial history**. Barack OBAMA is the 1st Black President of the US. But his mother was white. Why ? Because of the **one-drop rule** (if you are 1% black you’re black), a rule defined during slavery and segregation. Some people asked « Is Obama black enough ? » = difficulty to define race in US. Why ? No slave ancestors, raised only in his white family in the state of Hawaï (not big racist society). 

« Reparations Now » campaign with a picture telling « They Owe Us » = nod to « **forty acres and a mule** ». Just after Civil War 1861-1865. Behind this slogan was the idea that planters had become rich thanks to their slaves and that it was unacceptable ⇒ it is legitimate for the government to seize their land and redistribute it to former slaves. It remained a slogan ⇒ never done… Black rights remained theoretical…

**Lynching** was used to show to blacks that they should not complain. **1921** : Tulsa massacre in Oklahoma. They were a relatively prosperous black community. A white mob systematically destroyed their housed and murdered them. They decided to move North (understandable). It is called the **Great Migration (WWI-1960s, 90% → 30% in the South)** **≈ 6m of African American relocated**. Low skilled jobs available. But the North did not provide social and economic equality either (also lynchings in the North…). Henry FORD : reactionary ⇒ detested cities ⇒ set factories in suburb of Dearbone (white-only) ⇒ segregation. 

**1964** : Civil Rights Act 

**1965** : Voting Rights Act (guaranteeing the first one). But they remained poor. No equality of opportunities. « Freedom is not enough » said L.B JONHSON in a speech. « We seek not just legal equity but human ability » ⇒ affirmative action (universities, state contracts), temporary conception to catch-up the delay. 

**Busing** = affirmative action to address issues related to the catchment area and to housing inequalities to create diversity in schools (1970s- early 1980s, because white families disliked the system). 

**Affirmative action creates winners but also real (and perceived) loosers** ⇒ **challenge for judges**

**1978** : BAKKE ruling on universities admissions. The court said that **affirmative action = constitutional.** The 9 justices produced 6 separate opinions. So **no agreement about why !** But they also asserted that universities cannot have **no quotas**. The justification = white students will discover different people opening them to the diversity of the US ! 

**The economic gap is still huge** (median black wealth = 10% of median white wealth). Maybe affirmative action is not the right tool to achieve equality.

**Notable race riots** : 
- 1965 : shows that blacks did not believe that the Civil Rights Act would solve the problem alone + happened in the West (shows that racial inequality is a national issue). 

**No real turning points after the Civil Rights**… 

Argument against affirmative action : 
- **Intellectually confusing** 
- **Create loosers and no massive support** among population (even among black and democrats)
- **Hasn’t succeeded yet** 
- A **blunt instrument** (because ∃ African-American upper class)

**Jack and Jill of America’s balls** (= African-American upper class). Kamala HARRIS benefited from affirmative action (but her father was economist at Stanford…). 

But there is a **need of social mobility** (today UE’s social mobility > USA’s ) but perhaps on the **basis of income** (ideally a combination of the two !). 

**Currently, elite colleges are doing affirmative action in favour of the rich** 
- Preferential treatment for children of alumni
- Children of large donors 
- Recruited athletes (depends on the sports that the elite college decides to privilege : golf, sailing, fencing)

But, important to focus first on **community colleges** (better engine of opportunity because it gives a marketable job skill). **Elite colleges concerns few people !**
