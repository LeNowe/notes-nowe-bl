- **1920s** : + Catholics ⇒ in the South farmers and in the North working class
- After the **Great Migration** blacks started to vote for the DP (party of the employees)
- **1964-65** : The **Civil Rights Legislation** ⇒ end to this ambiguity ⇒ secured African American’s vote even in the South but lost the support of racist southerners
