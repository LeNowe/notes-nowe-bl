# Hollywood’s strike : poverty in Tinseltown ?
***
**Tinseltown** = ville clinquante = Hollywood 

**May 2023** : writers strike in Hollywood. The Union *Writers guild of America* (WGA). **Apparition of streaming platforms and their economic model**. **No minimum wages and fear of AI.** SAG-FTRA (*Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists*) union joined the strike. First strike since 1960. Famous actors boycotted ceremonies. They’ll probably loose the strike. 

**Always a shift in the technology**
- **1960** = television becomes common 
- **1980** = pay TV and VCR
- **2023** = streaming 

Already a long strike. The screenwriters have been in strike since may. Nothing is currently shot in Hollywood. High level of media hype. Small compared to California’s working class. Yet the strike has been spectacularly visible. Hollywood is an international industry + some of the strikers are stars. Contrast = **poverty in Tinseltown !** Covid accelerate the phenomenon but the real cause is streaming. It has upended actor’s **residuals** (  royalties when they are TV rerun of a film ) = form of guaranteed income. Indeed **residuals doesn’t exist on streaming platforms : actors get payed only once**. They stand up together against studios’ CEOs but it also huge inequalities among actors themselves. 

On **AI**. 
- **2016** : *Rogue one* = prequel of first *Star wars* trilogy. Recreated young Carrie FISHER as Leia.
- Difficult to replace stars but **background actors** could be completely replaced by A.I. 
- **Luddism (1811-1816)** = a protest movement in the textile industry against mechanisation. Workers had lost their job to machines and decided to destroy the machines. By extension the term is used to described hostility towards technology. We use the noun and adjective : a **luddite**. 

D**o studios have enough profits to better pay actors ? It seems not**. How historically movie studios made their money ? 

**The crisis of the traditional business model based on hits and franchises** : cinema and TV reruns (↘). Profits tended to focus on box office and big hits. But **making hits started to be harder to achieve**. The industry understood it and created **franchise** (Star Wars, James Bond, etc.). But nowadays franchises started to work less ( <u>Ex</u> : net loss for *The Flash* or *Indiana Jones* ). Hard also to export Hollywood to China’s big market… 

**Streaming platform’s subscription model** minimises risks and the platform injected a lot of cash in the industry because they were **blitz-scaling** ( = when a new market appears you try to get the biggest market share). The platforms accept to lose money in the next years. But **investors started to have doubts because the market started to be saturated** and the price of Disney’s shares started to decline. 

**The industry is struggling. Hence the strikers are unlikely going to win the strike.**

**Update** : The strike led by actors and screenwriters in Hollywood that began in May 2023 has concluded. After 118 days of labour stoppages, the Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) reached an agreement1. **The deal includes improvements to the minimum wage of workers, contributions to their pension funds, increased residual payments, and new rules regulating the use of artificial intelligence (AI)**. The agreement was reached after intense negotiations and is expected to be voted on by the union members.
