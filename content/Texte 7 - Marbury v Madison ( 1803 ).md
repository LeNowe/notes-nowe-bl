# Texte 7 - Marbury v Madison ( 1803 )
***
## Introduction 

**1800** : last hours of John ADAM’s presidency ( Federalist party ) and JEFFERSON is the vice-president. They are political ennemies. 
- Had to appoint number of judges to local counts. 
- ADAM appointed about ⅔ Federalist judges 
- Appointments confirmed the last day but only half of appointments delivered because JEFFERSON appointed his own « **midnight judges** ». 

⇒ William MARBURY, among non delivered appointments decided to sue the government.
- **1803** : case examined by Supreme Court 
- But embarrassing Supreme Court = Federalist majority disliking JEFFERSON 

Possibilities : 
- Plaintiff’s claim not valid. But that would acknowledge political superiority of JEFFERSON 
- Side with MARBURY’s claim but no means to enforce decision…
- They decided that MARBURY was right on validity of his appointment and in asking help of Supreme Court but also that claim was based on unconstitutional law. 
⇒ They created themselves Supreme Court power to declare constitutionality of laws = **judicial review** power.
