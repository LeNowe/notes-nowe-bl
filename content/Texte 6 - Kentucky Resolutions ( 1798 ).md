***
## Introduction 

**1797-1801** : **John ADAMS’ term** ( 2nd president )
- Political situation = tensed = emergence of the **first two party system** and JEFFERSON = vice-president
	- **Federalist Party** = ADAMS & HAMILTON 
	- **Democratic-Republican Party** = JEFFERSON & MADISON

**1798-1800** : **Quasi War with France** 
- Started with **XYZ Affair** = diplomatic incident ( = French agents of the foreign minister tried to bribe American diplomats )

⇒ The Federal Congress passed series of laws to fight against espionnage but also to pressure internal political opposition. 

**1798** : **Aliens and Sedition Acts** 
- **Naturalisation Act** : more difficult to acquire citizenship ( = 14 years of residency mandatory ) = accepted by Republicans 
- **Alien Friends Act / Alien Ennemis Act** = specific powers to President to expel aliens constituting a menace 
- **Sedition Act** : defined as « high misdemeanour » any behaviour considered a conspiracy against government. Could include writing an article against government = way of silencing opposition. 
- Seen by Republican as a return to pre-revolutionary English rule. Indeed some Republicans were actually prosecuted and put to jail. 

⇒ Dire situation for Republicans, considered it a deviation of Constitution principle + undue increase of presidential powers. The Supreme Court on hands of Federalist Party and had no power to declare an Act unconstitutional at that time. 

⇒ JEFFERSON & MADISON decided to retaliate by writing anonymously a series of resolutions presented to local assemblies of Kentucky and Virginia.
