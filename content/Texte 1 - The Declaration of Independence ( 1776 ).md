***
## Introduction 

**1756-1763** : **Seven Years Wars** 
- Britain + Prussia V.S France + Austria + Russia + Spain 
- Over the control of the colonies ( fur trad and cotton trade )
- Subwar = French and Indian War : agreements with Indian tribes against the British. 
	- Britain’s victory ⇒ Canada and Florida = Treaty of Paris **1763** 
- Costly war ⇒ New taxes in the colonies.

**1764** : **Sugar Act**, new tax on sugar, coffee and alcohol 
**1765** : **Stamp Act**, tax on administrative doc. 
**1765** : **Quartering Act** obliged accommodation of soldiers to reduce the cost of colonies’ army 
⇒ Resentment among population. ⇒ **1766** : The **Declaratory Act** repealed the Stamp Act 

**Virtual representation** = notion dev. by Lord GRENVILLE 
- MP’s right to speak for the interests of all British subjects, rather than for the interests of only the district that elected him. This legitimacy was contested by the colonies. Principle of consent over taxes inspired by Magna Carta. 

**1767** : the **Townshend Act** imposed new taxes on paper, glass and on lead.
- Provided that the N.Y assembly shouldn't have the right to pass bills 

**1770** : the **Boston massacre** = British soldiers V.S Colonists ( 5 ✞ )

**1773** : **Tea Act** meant to favour the British East Indian Company 
- As a matter of retaliation : boycott and **Boston Tea Party**  ⇒ Strong repression.

**1774** :  Coercive Acts / Intolerable Acts 
- **Boston Port Act** = shut down 
- **Massachussetts government Act** : a military governor that would have full power over the colony ⇒ existing institutions deprived of their power 
- **Administration of Justice Act** : trials could be transferred to London 
- **Quartering Act** 
- **Quebec Act** : more freedom to Catholics = insult to protestant 

**1774** : **Suffolk Resolves** 
- Suffolk county in Massachusetts that rejected the M.G.A and called for a boycott of all imported goods.
- Decided to form a new government : the Massachusetts Provincial Congress

**1774** : **First Continental Congress** 
- Delegates in order to coordinate the reaction against the Coercive Acts 
- Formulated a petition to the king George III ( right of petition = Bill of Rights ) ⇒ stilled believe in compromise and independence = marginal idea 
- John GALLOWAY presented a « plan of union » for the 13 colonies but within colonial status 

⇒ **1775** : **Battles of Lexington and Concord**, beginning of the **Independence War** 

**May 1775** : **Second Continental Congress** 
- **Conservatives** : strong central and elitist government ( federalist point of view )
- **Radicals** : power should be in the hands of the people directly = foreshadowing of anti-federalists  
- Decided to raise an army with George WHASHINGTON chief of this army 
- Comity of five members to write a declaration of Independence 
	- **John ADAMS** ( 2nd president of the U.S )
	- **Benjamin FRANKLIN** 
	- **Thomas JEFFERSON** 
	- **Robert LIVINSTON** 
- Considerable change in mindset : independence = majority idea but still some loyalists 

**July 4, 1776** : **Declaration of Independence** voted and ratified by 12 colonies ( ≠ Georgia )

**1777** : **Articles of Confederation** = 1st form of organisation 
- It took four years for the 13 to ratify all of them ⇒ only ratified in **1781** because it was not consensual at all 
⇒ **1787** : **Philadelphia Convention** ⇒ constitution
