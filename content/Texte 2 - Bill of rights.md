## Introduction 

In **1649** occured the first english revolution 
	- King Charles the first was beheaded 
	- The chaotic regime of the Commonwealth started headed by Oliver Cromwell

The Inter-Regnum period lasted until 1660 with the return of the monarchy with the king Charles II. The same year he signed the **Declaration of Breda** in which he stated that he would forgive the crimes committed during and the Civil War and govern with the parliament to restore order. But actually he ruled like an absolute monarch.

The Clarendan Code : if you don’t have the same religion as your monarch you’re a possible threath.
	- **1661** : the Corporation Act excluded non-conformists ( non-anglican protestant ) from public office
	- **1662** : Act of Uniformity make the Book of Common Prayer ⇒ every church in the country must use this book 
	- **1664** : the Conventicle Act prohibited the meeting of non-conformists 
	- **1665** : the Five Mile Act prohibited non-conformists to teach in schools and also to come within 5 miles of a city of which they have been banished. 

**1673 and 1678** : Test Acts obliged anyone willing to take a public office or to sit in the house of commons to make an oath of allegiance in which they said that they did’nt believe in the doctrine of transsubstantiation. ⇒ to be sure they were no catholics in the administration. ( These acts were repealed in **1828** ).

Charles II tried to show that he was protecting the anglican church whereas he was suspected to have catholics sympathies.

**1672** : Charles II tried to pass an Act of Indulgence to garanty religious freedom in the kingdom. Under the pression of parliament he withdrew.

**1679** : the Popish plot is a conspiracy 
	Anglican priest Titus Oats, he had direct access to the king ⇒ he made up a story telling that they was a plot to assasinate him ⇒ Charles II arrested a lot of people and executed them 
	Context of paranoia about the place and the power of catholicism in the kingdom ( due to the fact that James, the king’s brother was a catholic )

James’ first two daughters were protestant but James married a Italian woman, Mary of Modina, and had a son with her, James Edward Francis Stuart. ⇒ threat of the beginnin of a new and protestant dynasty 

⇒ The Exclusion Crisis : the idea emerged that the line of succession needed to be changed ⇒ Whigs V.S The Tories 
⇒ Charles II used his influence to convince the Lords to do not vote a bill changing the line of succesion James remain the official heir 

**1681** : Charles II disolved the parliament. 

**1685** : Charles II died, James became king James II in an tent situation 

James took few decision that worried the population by using his royal prerogatives : 
	- Suspension power 
	- Dispension power 

On top of that he set up a standing army ( permanent army ) in time of peace. He put catholics at its highest places. People thought the king was about to impose his religion to the people.

⇒ A delegation of MPS sent a letter to William of Orange, the husband of Marry, James’ protestant daughter.

⇒ James flee the country and remain in exile in France & William and Marry ruled.

J.E.F became the Pretender and was supported by the Jacobites. They organised rebellions but they were crushed by the crown.

But MPs asked them to sign a declaration limiting their powers. It became the **Bill of rights**.
**1688-1689** : The Glorious Revolution or the Bloodless Revolution 
	- Charles II died without heirs
	- James, his brother, was the next in line
	- But he was a catholic ( he refused to take the Test Act ) ( huge problem )
