***
## Introduction 

**Andrew JACKSON ( 1767 - 1845 )** 
- Born of Scottish-Irish immigrants in South Carolina 
- Fought in the Independence war as a young boy 
- From a poor family ⇒ considered as one of the 1st examples of a self-made man 
- Studied law then became prosecutor + judge and later Congressman 
- Became a wealthy plantation and slave owner 
- **1812** : became famous as a famous militia general in the war of 1812 ⇒ military hero fighting Indians and British 
- **1821** : military governor of Florida 
- **1823** : elected senator 
- **1824** : ran for President’s election. No one won majority. House of Representatives elected John QUINCY ADAMS. Jacksonian thought election to have been rigged by secret agreement between ADAMS and Henry CLAY.
- He became one of the main figure of the emerging Democratic Party 
- **1828** : ran again for Presidency with Jacksonian Democracy. He defeated ADAMS and presented his victory as the people’s one against the elites. He appointed Martin VAN BUREN as Secretary of State and formed a « **kitchen cabinet** » formed of friends and newspaper editors = informal government in the kitchen of the White House. 
- **1831** : defended state authority against Supreme Court decision in Georgia v. Cherokee Nation
- **1832** : reelected against Henry Clay.

**1828** : **nullification crisis** 
- Reaction of South Carolina against the « American system » defined by CLAY = economic policy of protectionist tariffs + federal investments in infrastructure. Southern states thought it advantaged mainly Northern states.
- JACKSON tried to curb impact of plan by vetoing some proposals and by putting pressure on Congress. But thought insufficient by South Carolina led by John CALHOUN 
- **1832** : nullified plan = tariff null and void. 
- JACKSON issued a proclamation declaring the country « indivisible » and saw nullification as an « act of treason ». At the same time he tried to reduce tariff ⇒ South Carolina finally withdrew nullification. 

The 1st Bank’s charter only ran until **1810** and was not renewed but government had difficulty to found its policies. 
- **1816** : MADISON had a 2nd Bank created with a 20 years charter 
- JACKSON opposed to National Bank thought an instrument of corruption. 
- Opposition between defenders of the National Bank ( Nicholas BIDDLE, CLAY ) and JACKSON and the Democratic Party. 
- **1832** : opposition to National Bank = core of JACKSON campaign ⇒ motto = « JACKSON and no bank ». Elected he refused to renew charter and vetoed the bill. 
- Gov. deposits transferred to private banks ( led to economic crisis )

**Jacksonian democracy** 
- Popular will and common people V.S moneyed and corrupted elite.
- Kept railing against privileges of political class
- Anti federalist conception 
- Strengthen the executive branch : 
	- Federalist conception 
	- Declared nullification a treason 
	- Opposition to Supreme Court in Cherokee v. Georgia 
- Massive use of veto power + continuous opposition to Congress 
- Laissez-faire policy 
	- Limited gov. intervention 
	- Hostility towards monopolies and intervention in social issues 
	- Public education seen as way for gov. to influence population 
- Fierce patriotism : nationalist stance : « national gov. » v.s state autonomy but also claimed to defend states’ rights 
- Belief in agrarian society : farmer = virtous 
- Extension of suffrage : still census-based in many states ( most barriers lift under JACKSON )
- « **Spoils system** »
	- Civils servants should not be independent but politically oriented
	- Thought **1824** election was lost because of political maneuvers
	- If a President elected but civil servants not on his side, he thought they would put obstacle in his path ⇒ New civil servants appointed by each President when he come into power = only politically oriented civil service could help President to achieve its goal.
	- ⚠ It still exists in US for the top civil servants 

## Analysis 

- **I ) An anti federalist stance claiming to defend people’s interests and state’s rights**
- **II ) Reinforcing the executive indicting Congress and judicial review of President**
- **III ) A populist perspective with a Manichean approach corrupted elites/virtous people  and a stance of providential man**
