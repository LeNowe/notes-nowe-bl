# Texte 22 - Malcolm X, « The Black Revolution » ( 1965 )
***
## Introduction 

Born in 1925. Real name : Malcolm Little. Born in Omaha. Son of a Baptist preacher, active in **the GARVEY movement, poor background.** His home was burnt by Klansmen during his childhood, his father was killed in mysterious circumstances, the children were split up.

He moved to Boston, left school, turned to petty crime, was arrested for burglary and was sentenced to 10 years in 1946.In prison, he joined **the** **Nation of Islam**, a Muslim group founded by WALLACE FARD and led by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

He was released in 1952, took the name of MALCOLM X, claiming to repudiate the “white man’s name”. He became a minister in one of the movement’s Temples. He quickly climbed the hierarchy of the movement. Made TV appearances.

He belongs to **the black nationalist movement** (= belief that trying to operate with a system deemed to be racist was doomed to failure and that only an autonomous nation-state or race-based economic, social and political institutions can enable Afro-Americans to fulfill themselves as they consider themselves as wholly differentiated from the other ethnic groups).

He argued against integration into white society and in favour of **Black separatism**. He claimed Blacks had to build their own institutions and should defend themselves against racist violence and oppose violence to violence.

He thus stood against **MARTIN LUTHER KING** (president of **the Southern Christian Leadership Conference**) and against the **NAACP**, which defended integration, interracial cooperation and a pluralistic society and used methods based on legal action.

He gradually moved away from the Nation of Islam. Whereas the organization was intent on staying out of politics, MALCOLM X believed that political mobilization was indispensable. He participated in boycotts and other forms of protest. In 1954, he made a speech comparing the situation in Vietnam and a local rebellion in Kenya, deeming both movements to be instances of uprisings of the “Darker races” against western imperialism. He toured several African countries (Egypt, Sudan, Nigeria, Ghana).

Tension gradually rose with the Nation of Islam and its leader. In 1964, MALCOLM X created **Muslim Mosque, Inc.**, an Islamic movement devoted to act in the political sphere.

He made his first pilgrimage to Mecca and took a second tour of African countries. He renamed himself EL-HAJJ MALIK EL-SHABAZZ, adopted Sunni Islam and announced that he had found the “true brotherhood” of man. He publicly acknowledged that Whites were not devils but still thought that Blacks needed to have their own institutions.

In 1964, he created **the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU)** which advocated:
- Black institutions (schools and cultural centers)
- Black participation in mainstream politics, incl. electoral campaigns

He was assassinated in 1965 by members of the Nation of Islam.

**MARCUS GARVEY** ( 1887-1940 ) founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which encouraged self-help and ethnic pride, sponsored black-owned business enterprises and promoted pan-African unity. The organization particularly attracted working-class blacks, whereas the NAACP was more popular among the middle class. Published the _Negro World_ newspaper. He dreamed of a mass return of American Blacks to Africa.
## Analysis 

- Ambiguous stance inspired by the Independence War 
- « Uncle Tom » = cf. *Uncle Tom’s cabin* Harriet Beecher STOWE represents the integrated black man who accepts white domination 
- Desire to appeal with the black working class ⇒ linguistic violence to break the codes of politics 
- « worldwide black revolution » 
- Influenced by Maoism 
- Tension between violent conception of R° and « bloodless » R° 
- Ambiguity between integrationism and separationism
