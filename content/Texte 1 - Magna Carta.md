### Introduction 

**1066** : battle of Hastings ⇒ William the Conqueror, duke of Normandy defeated Harold. He took advantage of the crisis of succession caused by the death of Edward the Confessor.

But William was considered as a tyrant in England

⇒ The **Norman Yoke** ( le joug Normand ) : the english nobility and gentry considered that the Norman rule in England was illigitimate, violent and oppressive.

⇒The nobility portrayed**The myth of freeborn Englishman** wich is an idealized state of freedom 

⇒ several rebellions and uprisings occured and were brutally repressed ⇒ the Normans strenghten their grip on the populat° by expropriate the english aristocrats to settle norman aristocrats ⇒ creat° of the Anglo-Norman elite 

⇒ The feudal syst. ( pyramidal scheme with suzerain and vassals ) developped, organized to strenghten the norman rules based on fiefs given for services.
	- serves : 99% of populat°
	- freemen : less than a % 

Caution : if your suzerain give you a land you’re a tenant not the owner 

At the time : **King by divine right** but rule with a council called the Curia Regis ( assembly of noble men, aristocrats and churchmen ) 

the Witenagemot –> the Curia regis 

1215 : Curia Regis –> the Parliament 

After W. the Conqueror his successors ( H.I and H.II ) enlarged the empire ( mariage, conquests ) ⇒ the Anglo-Angevine Empire ( England, Dukedom of Normandy, Aquitaine and other provinces acquired )

But their successors, King John or John Lackland, destroyed the Empire :
- He did not manage his possesions in France
- He levied a lot of taxes ⇒ discontent 
- He met defeats against Philippe II of France 
- He had difficulties wth the Pope 
	- the Pope Innocent III wanted to name  Steven Langdon as the Archbishop of Canterbury, highest catholic churchman in England ⇒ John did not want to acknowledged him ⇒ John was excommunicated ⇒ comply to the Pope to be reintegreted but had to become the Vassal of the Pope ⇒ the Barons,major landowners and John’s Vassals rebelled against him and forced him to sign a document to limit his royal prerogatives, it was the **Magna Carta**.

The first document formally limiting the power of the monarch signed by the king.
