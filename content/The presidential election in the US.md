# The presidential election in the US
***
**Super Tuesday** : Nikki HALEY defeated by TRUMP (even if she managed to win a ¼ of the votes) ⇒ she cancelled her candidacy, TRUMP is now the only Republican candidate. **US seems to move towards a rematch** ! 

**The rematch is not wanted** = experienced as a failure and an anomaly. BIDEN’s candidacy is not unusual but TRUMP’s one is. **Neither of the two candidates create enthusiasm in the Nation** (and not only in the party) More of 70% of the Nation think that the Nation is badly lead (same under TRUMP). **The system is failing to renew itself**. 

**Impossible to have a third-party candidate because of the winner-takes-all system**. Insurgent candidate (like TRUMP) in the US tries to be nominated by one of the two big parties. Today, the biggest insurgent candidacy is the one of Robert KENNEDY Jr. He was a Democrat (and Kennedy’s name) but he’s much more closer to Rep (anti-vax conspiracy) ⇒ he will eventually take some votes from each side. 

**BIDEN = only possible nominee** because he’s the incumbent president (you’re already famous + political credibility). A primary would not have changed the result but it would have been hurt his popularity (public criticisms) ⇒ other Dem gave up. But **why he decided to run** ? In 2020 he promised to run for only 4 years to pave the ground for a younger candidate. The impression at that time was : democracy is at risk but if TRUMP looses he will disappear. When TRUMP announced that he will run for presidency again, **BIDEN probably thought that he was best placed to beat TRUMP again**. 

**Why TRUMP is running again for presidency ?** **Psychological factor** : he wants revenge ! Also, it is **either the White House or jail** ! 

**TRUMP completely destroyed Nikki HALLEY during Super Tuesday**. So **it looks like TRUMP is popular. But it is partly an optical illusion** (the voters during primaries = more activist fringe of the electorate). 

**Since 2016, The Republican Party is not the Republican Party anymore but TRUMP’s party**.
- Exodus of Republican moderates (politicians and party members, retirement, independent)
- Purge of RINO’s (political atmosphere is more violent)
- It is became an homogeneous party (≠ Dem)

<b><u>Ex</u> : the Party doesn’t care of TRUMP behavior</b>
- **2016** : « Access Hollywood » tape of TRUMP (« grab’em by the pussy ») ⇒ the Rep party declared « ok it is just banter » (*i.e* these are just words). 
- **2023** : A <u>jury</u> finds Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The Rep party said nothing. 

<b><u>Ex</u> : the Party now supports TRUMP’s lies about the result of elections</b> 
- **2020** : M. PENCE « proud » to have confirmed result of elections 
- **2024** : Mike JONHSON (Speaker) was one of the most active politicians supporting TRUMP’s lies 

TRUMP released a song praising J6 and « the J6 choir » (men imprisoned for their role in the attack of the US Capitol). 

**2024’s elections are decisive on a geopolitical point of view** 
- The future president has to be competent to make **big big big decisions** <u>Ex</u> : China and Taïwan, Russia and Europe. And **TRUMP is not competent**. His advisers noticed that he has a **very small attention-span**. 
- **Compounding factor = the influence of new technologies** on how the war are fought ⇒ US’s armement might be outdated (nobody knows) ⇒ the question is destabilising the world order

**TRUMP’s lawyers tried to claim his absolute immunity** (= he should be above the rule of law). He admires PUTIN and ORBAN. **He has few respect for democratic institutions**. The counterargument would be : he had already been president and nothing terrible happened ! But **TRUMP 2016 ≠ TRUMP 2024**. Because in 2016, the Rep Party was not fully supporting TRUMP ⇒ acting as a sort of check during presidency. Now the Rep Party is TRUMP’s party. Also, he arrived with no precise platform and with no list of people to appoint to administrative positions. 

**1973** : Creation of the **Heritage Foundation**, right-wing think-tank that was considering that Nixon was too much influenced by liberals ideas ⇒ **Reaganite body**. Now they are isolationist and are working to « **institutionalise Trumpism** ». 

**Who is going to win ?** For now, we have now clue and **the two candidates are neck and neck** (and the polls are largely irrelevant). Democrats will probably have more votes but not necessarily more great electors (because rural states are over-represented among Great electors). BIDEN is not the clear fore-runner.

Many Americans saw TRUMP’s mandate as change and not chaos. **Some trumpists don’t see the problem of an authoritarian democracy**. 

**BIDEN is blamed for mismanaging the economy**. **But in fact, the situation is rather good and people seems to ignore it**… 

Except the issue of illegal immigration, **BIDEN has a good record and he’s not credited for it**. 
- **Fewer Americans without health insurance** 
- Inflation has decreased spectacularly = **soft landing** (killing off inflation without a recession) 
- **Real wages are increasing** faster than inflation 

The problem of age is less perceptible in TRUMP (more energetic). 

**Fundamental asymmetry : TRUMP is at head of his own party/BIDEN is at head of a coalition** 
**⇒ To what extent should the Democratic party be a working-class party ?**
- **1980s-1990s** : The rise of the « **New Democrats** » (B. CLINTON) = right of the Dem (they claimed that sometimes state intervention was counterproductive)
- **1992** : CLINTON promised to « **end welfare** [unemployment benefits] **as we know it** »
- **1996** : **welfare reform** (benefits from needy family became temporary) ⇒ ↘ number of family benefiting from it (but in a period of economic growth ⇒ not intolerable consequences)
- But **New Democrats ⇒ the fraying of the safety net** 
- **Became a party of well-educated middle class workers** 

**September 2023** : BIDEN = 1st president to visit a picket line, he described himself as the most union-friendly president since ROOSEVELT. 

schéma 

**↗ blank votes during Dem primaries** (middle class liberals and left-wing leaning in favour of Palestine). **BIDEN needs to win in Michigan** (big Muslim community).
