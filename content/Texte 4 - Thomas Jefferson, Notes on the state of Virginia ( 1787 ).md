- HAMILTON’s view prevaded ⇒ National Bank was created ⇒ JEFFERSON resigned and retired. But come back and run for the Presidency against WASHINGTON’s vice-president,  John ADAMS ( = Federalist ) 
- Two parties had emerged ( = first party system ) : Federalist ( = supporters of HAMILTON ) v.s Republicans ( = supporters of JEFFERSON ). 
- ADAMS won and JEFFERSON became vice-president a.k.a President of the Senate ⇒ tensions !! 
- Fierce opposition over the **Alien and Sedition Acts** ( **1798** ) = meant to silence opposition 
- **1800** : JEFFERSON won against ADAMS but hard luck in tie with Aaron BURN. Finally he’s elected by the House of Representatives. 
- 1st action = repeal A.S Acts
- 1st term quite successful : reduced military spending and bought Lousiana from France but deterioration relations with BURN.
- **1804** : Re-elected. Huge scandal over BURN = killed HAMILTON in duel and conspired against U.S ( but acquitted ! ). Also strong trade difficulties because of Napoleonic Wars. 
- He retired from politics : founded Universtiy of Virginia and became President of American Philosophical Society.
