## Texte 12 - Herbert Asquith, speech delivered in the House of Commons ( 29 March 1910 )
***
**Issue at stake** : How Asquith tries to convince the Lords of the necessity of a democratic reform of their Chamber considering the advent of the modern world of mass opinion ? 

I. The assertion of democratic principles 
II. The limits of representative government balanced by the wisdom of the second chamber 
III. A reform in the wake of Britain’s history and inspired by the Burkean conception of conservatism 

To what extent Asquith tries to appear as a moderate reformer that does not try to turn the constitution upside down 

I. The reforms as a technical one, a very cautious approach trying to depart to ideology 
II. A reforming stance that advocates a constitutional change. A new paradigm : election replaces tradition 
III. The Burkean gradual approach : a reform based on historical continuity 

Conclusion : the Bill voted one y. later and it definetly marked the reverse of power 
1949 : delaying power reduced to one year 
2010 :
