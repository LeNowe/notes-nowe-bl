## Freedom of speech in the US

- Harvard former president
- Antisemitism in the university 
- Resigned after 6 months 
- Allegation of plagiarism (but Harvard stated that is just a lack of quotation)
- **January 2024** : She resigned 
- **2006** : SNYDER v. PHELPS ruling 
- American universities hinge on donors 

The **Gaza crisis is divisive among Democrats** (reminiscent of how the Vietnam War was divisive among them, also generational division). It is about **who is perceived as the weak** (the Dem party being considered as the defender of the weak). 
- **Senior → pro Israel** (post-WWII memories)
- **Younger → sympathy for Palestinians** 

In **US universities → overwhelmingly liberal culturally** ⇒ **lean in favour of Palestinians** and tend to be an **echo chamber**

Important concept of **asymmetrical polarisation** (proof : TRUMP is an extreme Republican, the Democrats chose BIDEN and not Bernie SANDERS). 

**⇒ Legal restrictions of the freedom of speech by the political right**
- Lot of **separate school bans** (banning books, 1600 titles). But attended by only 4 million students (75 million of Americans aged 0-17). So, it’s not *Fahrenheit 451* !
- **2022** : Florida governor forbid discussing about homosexuality in state schools 
- **Critical race theory (CRT)** is also banned in some state schools (= claiming that there is institutional racism). 

**⇒ But also extra-legal actions such as boycott**
- **Bud Light** was fearing a decline of its sales among the youth. So decided to make an advertising campaign with a transgender gender ⇒ **big boycott led by conservatives people** ⇒ ↘ 20% of sales and Bud Light lost its place ⇒ **« Don’t be Bud Light »** = informal slogan among marketing experts *i.e* don’t take part in conflict of values. 

**Republican In the Name Only** (RINO) = concept created by the tea party movement (≈2008 after OBAMA’s election-2016) = try to purge the Republican side. 

**⇒ James BENNETT, former *NY Times* leftist editor who had to resigned = so there is also DINO**
- Forced to resign by pressure within the newspaper during the riots after George FLOYD’s death
- He opened the op-ed to Tom COTTON, an army veteran calling for the use of troops 

**JK ROWLING** publicly refused to claim that transgender women are actual women ⇒ leftist attempt to boycott/blacklist her ⚠ She is from the left (vote Labour, stay in Europe) and she suffered abuse (so she fears possible « fake » transgender abusing women). 

**⇒ The rise of cancel culture = left’s instrument to limit freedom of speech** 
- **Boycott** all of somebody’s production (bc if you buy someone’s book you became an enabler)
- **Deplatforming** (limit somebody’s ability to make it’s opinion public)  

**1st amendment logic = Enlightenment’s idea of a marketplace of ideas** with responsible and rational individuals. It **implies to tolerate hateful speeches** (rational people will say that it is bullshit !)

**1969** : **BRANDENBURG v. Ohio** = need of « producing <u>imminent</u> lawless action » (because no time for counter argument). Hence, for a KKK member it is constitutional to say « we must lynch all black who dared to vote » but unconstitutional to say « let’s now lynch Mr Smith, a black man who dared to vote ». 

## The culture war

So, **America has a Free Speech Problem** = **shift from political correctness to cancel culture** (you claim that somethings should not be said at all, even if they could be refuted properly). According to polls, a majority (≈60%) of Americans declares that they are not enjoying their freedom of speech. 

Why this shift ? **Social networks** essentially…

To refuse the debate = show of weakness (if you believe that everyone is rational). But if the right and the left are trying to cancel the other, it means that **the two sides believe they are loosing the cultural war**  = **reason of the radicalisation of discourse** !

The fact that **all of culture has been politicised** ⇒ less importance of the distribution of wealth. The debate is more focused on values and identity. **Harder to find a middle ground** (you can find a middle tax but no such solutions about abortion…). It is a **war** **because it does not allow compromise**. 

**⇒ Pat BUCHANAN, speech before the Republican National Convention, 1992** = « **culture war** » depicted as a « religious war ». 

**The most obvious battlefields** : 
- **Abortion** 
- The rights of **homosexuals**
- The place of religion in **society** 
- **Gun rights** 
- Increasingly, the question of **immigration** (treated in a extreme way, no compromise can be made)
- **Structural racism** within institutions 

But it is difficult to identify clearly the two sides and how the war is fought ! Even **the shape of the war is contingent** ! But basically liberal America is on the side of autonomy (you can manage your life as you wish) and Conservative America is on the side of social norms (diversity is less desirable).

But ⚠ the war predated 1992 ! When took place the shift from economic debate to debate on values !  **Probably in the 1960s** (debate on culture became dominant !) : 
- The **Vietnam War** crystallised generational tensions 
- Political realignment with the **Civil Rights Act of 1964** (the southerns democrats left the Democratic Party, no more conservative wings within this Party ⇒ political polarisation is clearer ⇒ facilitated the rise of the culture war). 
- Activistes movement on both sides (more ideology in the Rep party)

## The Republican Party : from centrism to ideological radicalisation 

> I like Ike ! – 1952 

**EISENHOWER**’s « middle of the road » presidency : a fairly **unideological administration (1952-1960)**. He was envisaged as a possible nominee by both parties !! 

**1964** : The **return of ideology** with Barry **GOLDWATER** ⇒ considered that the Rep party was Republican in the name only (≈ right wing of the Democratic party : prudent desegregation, containment, more state intervention). He did not come from nowhere !!

[insert quote]

GOLDWATER platform in 1964 : 
- End social security 
- Roll back labour law 
- Defeat the USSR 

He was the Republican nominee in **1964** but was **completely destroyed electorally**. His ideas were **perceived as completely irrelevant** (« In your guts, you know he’s nuts ! ») !  But there was already **popular support** in favour of ideological right ! 

**1947** : **Taft-Harley Act** = not everything is an object of consensus (collective bargaining yes but not everything). **Republican never completely accepted the New Deal**. 

Influence of the **conservative thinker William BUCKLEY** founder of the ***National review* (1955)** = not a mass magasine but key role in the recreation of rightist ideology. 

**Activist group** = **Young Americans for Freedom** (YAF founded in **1960**) with the support of GOLDWATER, REAGAN, BUCKLEY) ⇒ not yet a political movement but not simply intellectual because they claim that they will campaign and influence politics ! Members were middle-class/business interests ⇒ **not everybody was at Woodstock !** 

Two members of the ideological right : 
- **Free-market advocates** 
- **Social conservatives** 
- Potentially conflictual views on individualism…

**GOLDWATER’s defeat is a disaster but also the beginning of something from the Republican = winning southern states** ! 

**⇒ Kevin PHILIPS** (conseiller de NIXON)**, *The Emerging Republican Majority*, 1969**
- Suggested that the Republican can secure Nationwide majority to fight against the New Deal coalition = attracting to the Republican party historically Democratic voters (Southern whites) ⇒ sending discret signals that racism is not a huge problem 
- **Late 1960s** : the ND coalition started to decline 

**1972** : **Phyllis SCHLAFLY’s campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment** (saying that women have the same rights as men). Looked like an amendment that could not fail to pass ! Yet, it was never passed because of her campaign = **fulfilling BUCKLEY’s wish to stop history !** She managed to get the support of both Catholics and evangelicals ! 

**Shift in the Republican party** : 
- **1970s-2016** : The Republican establishment used the culture more than believed in it. 
- **2016-now** : The traditional Republican establishment has lost control over the movement taking part to the culture war ! **Culturally motivated voters controls the party** (hence TRUMP). 

**Tribal politics** = 2 **tribes** (conservatives v. liberals) ⇒ you identify as conservative/liberal so you automatically adopt some political opinions ! (« **I’m a conservative thereof…** ») ⇒ elections are not won by mobilising swing voters but by mobilising your base. 

**⇒ Indiana Law requires professors to promote « intellectuel diversity » (in March 2024)** 
- Republican law (we want more diversity in the diversity = we want right-wing view points) 
- Even teacher with tenure (= titulaire) could be fired 
- Measure encouraging intellectual diversity but possibly limiting the liberty of lecturers
