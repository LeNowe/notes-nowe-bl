# The Supreme Court in the US
***
SC = **appellate jurisdiction** that can strike down legislation/executive orders in the name of the Constitution ( = power of « **judicial review** » ) 

Very often it looks like the SC is doing **legal and not judicial things** 
- **1896** : PLESSY v. FERGUSON = « separate but equal »
- **1954** : BROWN v. TOPEKA ruling declared Segregation unconstitutional 
- **2015** : OBERGEFELL v. HODGES declared that no state can ban same-sex mariage ( in the UK Marriage Act of 2013 ). 
- **Central role in America’s institutions** <u>Ex</u> : the SC is build next to the Capitol

**BUT it was not always true !** 
- **1803** : MARBURY v. MADISON = 1st Act of Congress to be struck down 
- **1857** : 44 years after, SCOTT v. SANDFORD = 2nd time 

**Since 2005** = more than 60 times !! What happened ?
- A **structuring effect** = fewer laws were passed in the XIX<sup>e</sup> 
- **Judges are more confident** that they can challenge the Congress 
- The SC has to in front of **check and balances’ vetocracy** ( increased by polarisation )

schéma prof sur le système check and balances 

The **system of checks and balances is working too well**. It became a « **vetocracy** ». An Act of Congress has to be approved by the Congress ( HoR + Senate ) then by the President. But in the Senate you can **filibuster** ( according to the rule’s book of the Senate when a senator is speaking no one has the right to interrupt him ). 

So some **white supremacist senators filibustered** to avoid banning segregation ! You can make a **vote of closure** to make the filibuster shut up but it needs 60% of the Senate. 

**So if you want to enact a law you need** : 
- \> 50% in Congress
- \> 60% of the Senate ( because of filibustering ) 

Because the Congress could not enact the abolition, the SC had to. Indeed, this institution is less checked and balanced that the other. 

**How do you become a Justice ?**
- Nominated by President 
- Confirmed by the Senate 

**How do you cease to be a Justice ?**
- Death 
- Retirement 
- ( theoretically, impeachment = ½ of HoR + ⅔ of Senate ⇒ it does not happen ) 

So it is **spectacularly undemocratic** because **no accountability**. It was thought to guarantee the independence of the court. But the Founding Fathers did not realise that it can play a big role in America’s politics. Since 1970 : Justice stayed ≈ 26 years. 

**⇒ Several ways of reading the Constitution** ( they are each mad )
- **Living constitution theory** = constitution is a dynamic text and its meaning changes with time. The text is indeed very short and general. So lot of room for interpretation. But it implies that judges can interpret the text as they want. The fact that a Constitution is changing is paradoxical ≈ Democrats 
- **Originalism** = the Constitution means what its authors wanted it to mean. But the Founding Fathers did not agree on everything and we have no clue on what they would have thought on today’s issues ≈ Republican  
- **Textualism** = the tex says what it is saying, literally. To make it unequivocal
- <u>Ex</u> : the « **equal protection clause** » = central because used to give rights to minorities in America. But the meaning differs according the interpretation. 

**⇒ Politicisation of the appointments is growing**. 
- **1968** : NIXON as a candidate said that he would only appoint judges that would <u>apply</u> the law and not <u>make</u> the law. 
- **1980s** : REAGAN started using **litmus-tests** to select judges 
- **1982** : Creation of « the **Federalist Society** » ( = defending states’ rights) = association of law students from Yale and Chicago ⇒ created a **conservative judicial counter-culture** defending originalism ⇒ the **SC became more and more conservative**. 
- **February 2016** : Justice SCALIA died during BO’s presidency ( with Republicans dominating the Senate ). The Senate refused to appoint’s BO’s candidate and said it’s too late the Presidential election is coming in November, let’s appoint a new Justice after the election ( they are inventing a rule ) ! So TRUMP won…
- **September 2020** : Ruth BADER GINSBURG died during TRUMP’s presidency two month before the election. Republicans were dominating the Senate and they said let’s appoint a justice really fast. So **Republicans want to secure conservative justice whatever the means**…
- **Political paralysis ⇒ ↗ SC’s activism**

Today, it’s possible to label the Justices : 5<sup>+</sup> conservatives v. 4<sup>–</sup> liberals ( one is swinging… )

**⇒ But politicisation and SC’s conservatism ≠ every ruling in favour of the RP** 
- **2023** : SC ruled against restricting diluting Black vote in Alabama = gerrymandering 
- SC’s struck down the « **independent state legislature doctrine** » = states alone organise elections & have the authority to count votes ( allowing RP to cheat ofc ! )

**In spite of this moderation in some rulings, the big picture = clear shift in favour of conservative ideas** ( <u>Ex</u> : Rahimi v. USA ). 

**⇒ Why politicisation is a « terrifying issue » ?** ( Bonneville )
- Huge polarisation ⇒ ∅ compromise & ↗ violence 
- SC’s is less politicised than Congress, etc and can legally arbitrate ( only if its decisions are accepted as legitimate !! )
- **2000** : Al GORE v. G. BUSH ⇒ the SC court ruled that BUSH had won. But today, more unlikely to happen… 
- **2023** : SOTOMAYNOR KAGAN and JACKSON dissented against BIDEN v. NEBRASKA ( on affirmative action ) and declared that « The Court violates the Constitution » and misused its powers. 

**⇒ Limits to power of SC : historical precedents**
- **1930s** : Conservative SC defending the « freedom of contract » and stopping the New Deal 
- **1935** : Schecter Poultry Corporation ⇒ struck down National Industrial Recovery ( but Democrats in favour of ROOSEVELT recently reelected with huge majority ). 
- So **FDR** threatened to **pack the Court** ⇒ outraged public opinion ! We cannot let the President destroys the checks and balances system ! So FDR’s failure. But the SC started to valid New Deal’s legislature to avoid that public opinion shifted against the Court. 

**⇒ Why Clarence THOMAS is mad ?** 
- Accepted money and gifts by rich conservative businessmen 
- Married v. Ginni THOMAS = trumpist  
- No evidence that he’s corrupted but terrible public image ⇒ ↘ public opinion’s trust 

**Novembre 2023** : SC published for the 1<sup>st</sup> a « code of conduct » But no enforcement mechanism !
