# Charles H. Pearson, *National Life and Character*, 1893
***
**⇒ Charles H. PEARSON**
- Went to rugby school then Oxford 
- Lecturer in history in Trinity College but didn’t like teaching 
- Went to Australia to become a sheep farmer 
- But it was too hard so he came back to teaching history 
- Racist and kind of a social Darwinist 

In *National Life and Character* (**1893**) PEARSON tries to predict Britain’s future. This is a hallmark of a period of uncertainty and change. « Black and yellow races » will rise and challenge Britain. **Pessimism of the late 19th century**. But there is also a **endogenous** decline = **rise in state intervention** ⇒ decline of individualism ⇒ decline of Britain. 

## <u>I. An age of transition</u>

### A ) The demise of old England 

- **1829** : Repeal of the Test and Corporation 
- **1846** : Repeal of the Corn Laws 

« Manhood suffrage » = **universal male suffrage** 
- **1832** : 4% → 8% ( of adult population ) = they presented as a **final defensive mesure** John RUSSELL or « Finality Jack »
- **1864** : GLADSTONE stated that any non-criminal/lunatic would eventually be able to vote 
- **1867** : → 16% 
- **1872** : Secret Ballot 
- **1884** : → 32% 

So, **triple decline of the landed aristocracy**. 
### B ) The rise of the State 

**↗ of gov’s intervention** 
- **1834** : Poor Law Amendment Act ⇒ nation-wide system to deal with poverty replacing parishes 
- **1870** : Forster Act 
- **Labour laws** <u>Ex</u> : **1871** : Legalisation of genuine trade unions 

**Second generation utilitarianism** ( ≈ JS MILL rather than BENTHAM ) = greater happiness but state should create the conditions for individuals to defend their interest. 

### C ) Progress 

Accumulation of small changes ⇒ new Britain = **Whig vision of history** **Historical change is determined by reason** ( = HEGEL ). 

## <u>II. Causes for concern</u>

### A ) Urban poverty 

**Staggering urbanisation** : 
- **1830s** : urban pop° > rural 
- **1900** : 80% of urban pop° 

**↘ material conditions** because **absence of urban planning ⇒ epidemics and pollutions**
- **1858** : **The Great Stink** caused because London did not have a sewage network ( human wastes in the Thames ) ⇒ suspended Parliament. BAZALGETTE btw 1859-1875 built London sewage network. 

Problem = **emigration no longer possible** ( closing of the Frontier in 1890 in the US ). 

**Rediscovery of poverty in the late-Victorian period**. 
- **1884** : **Creation of Toynbee Hall** = « social settlement » in East London. Oxford graduates sent to see how poor lived an try to improve them <u>Ex</u> : BEVERIDGE, ATTLEE
- **1886-1903** : **Charles BOOTH** ( = christian philanthropist ) wrote ***The life and Labour of the London Poor***. He founded that ⅓ of London’s population was poor ( = undeserving but also the <u>deserving poor</u> ). He also explained that poverty create crime crime and vice and not the opposite. **Challenged the belief in personal responsibility** ⇒ arguments to defend state intervention. 
- **1901** : Seebohm ROWNTREE thought London was a special case. So he tried to replicate BOOTH’s work in York. He expected to find very little poverty. But he founded exactly the same. 

He talks about a « **pariah class** » ( ref to India ) ⇒ **perception of racial decline**. 
- **1890** : <u>William</u> BOOTH, *In Darkest England, and the Way Out* = we’ve got to rechristianise the working class ⇒ foundation of the *Salvation Army* 

### B ) A divided nation : the fear of social unrest 

Risk that poverty might result in social unrest… PEARSON described a **class-ridden society**. Resurgence of a **2-nations vision**. 

Potential of class conflict. It would entailed a situation like in the US 
- « Unlimited issues of State paper » = **inflation** (cf. Silver Standard issues in the US)
- « Appoint of State officials generally by the ballot » = **election of civil servants** (cf. ↗ populist demand in the US). 

<b>So, late XIX<sup>th</sup> = return of the fear of social violence</b>
- Memories of Luddism and Chartism 
- **1886** : Trafalgar Square riot, looting in a rich district of London ⇒ revealed that public order could collapse anywhere and at anytime = scary 

But there is also **differences from the 1st Victorian Period** = the **situation is more threatening**, indeed !
- **Organisation of the working class** (unionism) <u>Ex</u> : 1889, Docker’s strike 
- **Political participation of the working class** <u>Ex</u> : Second and Third Reform Act (1867, 1884)
- Party’s failure to integrate the working class electorate ⇒ **political independence of the working class** <u>Ex</u> : Independent Labour Party, 1893 

> [!tip] Methodology
> A lot of end-of-the-XIX<sup>th</sup>-century texts refers to old Victorian fears (1830s-1840s). Because local problems born in this first period just became ubiquitous in the second (cf. industries everywhere = end of the XIX<sup>th</sup> century ).

## <u>III. The death of the Liberal paradigm</u>

### A ) The advent of genuine democracy 

Big changes going on. But PEARSON thinks that it does not involve the end of the Whig vision of history. **The elite remains the guide of the popular will**. But he seems that this possibility is very limited… But what about inevitable changes that the elite doesn’t want to happen ? He seems to understand his time but he remains attached to the WVH. 

### B ) The end of the individual 

He announces that t**he rise of the state cannot be stopped**. The masses will want more and more from the state ⇒ decline of the churches influence. <u>Ex</u> : Elementary Act (when ?). Fear of a **culture of dependency** = decline of self-help (cf. [[Texte 2 - Smiles, Self-Help, 1859]]). SMILES’s fear is perceived by PEARSON as an inevitable catastrophy. 

## Conclusion 

**Odd text because PEARSON don’t give up the Whig vision of history** even if he understands what is actually destroying it ≈ the **crisis of liberalism**. How can you still be a liberal when you realise that what individuals want is less individualism. **New Liberalism** tried to save liberalism by accepting greater state intervention. Liberals started to loose ground and were r**eplaced in the two-party system by the Labour Party** = only occurrence of one party disappearing from the political map and replaced by a new-one.
