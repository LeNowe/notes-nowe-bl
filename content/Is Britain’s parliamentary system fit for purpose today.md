# Britain’s parliamentary system fit for purpose today ?

- « Britain» ⇒ ne pas dire des trucs qui sont vrais partout (il faut répondre de façon spécifique)

## <u>I. Unimportant aspects (if nothing else comes to mind…)</u>

### A ) FPTP = First Past the Post system

**FPTP** = in each constituency (≠ proportional representation)
- **One round of voting** 
- Whichever candidate has **the most votes wins the seat** 

**⇒ In theory, some virtues** : 
- It gives 1 party an absolue majority of seats → **government should be effective**
- In favour of a **bipartisan system** ⇒ opposition = the government in waiting (you need to work !) = **« His majesty’s most loyal opposition »** = official name of the Labour party at the moment. Keir STARMER perceives a public wage (because considered as the future PM). Opposition has a **shadow cabinet**. Everything is prepared ! 

**⇒ But disadvantages** : 
- **Unrepresentativeness** 
	- Labour + Cons (1945-1974) = 90% of the electorate  
	- Since 1970s : ≈ 75% of the electorate 
- **End of butskellism** (= common ground) ⇒ **political polarisation**  
### B ) The House of Lords 

People who are **not elected have legislative powers** = **troubling**… 
- **1 year delaying power** (since 1949, 2 year in 1911-1949) = not important but can annoy a government wanting to legislate quickly
- **Hereditary peers** (1997, they asked them to select only of small number of them staying)
- **Life peers** (since 1958, became the main type of peer) : more talented in average (normally) 
- **Lords spiritual** (according to the function) <u>Ex</u> : Head of Church 

**Who do governments decides to name life peers ?** 
- Former ministers 
- Top civil servants 
- Academics 
- Doctors 
- Businessmen 
- Trade unionist 

The **House of Lords has more expertise (and diverse) than the House of Commons (professional politics only)**. Often, it notices things that the Commons misses ! But it knows it has a legitimacy problem. So if the Lords use too often their power, the institution will be threatened by public opinion.                

## <u>II. Real issues</u>

### A ) The « English Constitution »

**1867** : **W. BAGEHOT, *The English Constitution*** 
- Seems to be a book about something that does not exist. 
- Because, there is no single text called « the English Constitution ». 
- There are **fundamental rules** (= literally a « Constitution ») but it has **no codified constitution** 
- Several texts, common law and conventions and **it does work** <u>Ex</u> : no text saying that the PM is the head of the majority (so a convention is good enough)
- It makes possibles **gradual change**

In Britain, **sovereignty belongs to the « King-in-Parliament »** = combination of 3 things 
- ≈ King (or Queen)
- ≈ House of Lords 
- <u>House of Commons</u> ⇒ power in the hands in the majority party ⇒ in hands of the head of the majority party = PM 

But **sovereignty has moved**. 
- If HoL and HoC agree, the King automatically « says » yes. 
- And HoC > HoL 

**This shift took centuries, little by little, with no change in legal text**. 

Today, **Britain has parliamentary** (HoC) **sovereignty** 
- **∅ popular sovereignty** (in theory). Legally speaking the HoC could have refused Brexit. 
-  Nothing is superior to an ordinary Act of Parliament (if you vote a law abolishing monarchy it’s legal). Nothing can be undone by the Parliament. 
- So spectacularly **unchecked system** 
- Almost the most essential freedom are not **sacrosanct** 

> The British constitution has always been puzzling and always will be. – Queen Elizabeth II 

**1976** : PM, the « **elective dictatorship** » (Lord HAILSHAM) (so before THATCHER !)

It seems very **easy to turn UK into a dictatorship** <u>Ex</u> : *V for vendetta*, a comic by Alan MOORE and David LLOYD published in 1982-85. B**ut historically UK this potential has not been used at all** ! 

**Peter HENNESSY**, the **« good chap » theory of government** (bon gars) *i.e* strong democratic culture among the elite. 

Now **populist mood** everywhere (but in UK no institutions protecting democracy just culture). So potential shift ! 
- **2016** : *The Daily mail*, « Ennemies of the people » (about judges that had ruled that Theresa MAY could not invoke [… compléter diapo])
- **2023** : Rwanda Bill encroaching on the European Convention of Human Rights 

**When the decline in the political culture started to develop ?** 

⚠ From now on, uncertain ground (=BONNEVILLE’s advice)

**Late 1970s** (probably **1979** = THATCHER). When THATCHER came to power she saw Civil service differently from her predecessors. She considered that it had its own will and a specific agenda (= big state agenda). <u>Ex</u> : *Yes Minister*, TV-show during 1980s. So **THATCHER decided to circumvent the Civil service**. Then BLAIR too and most PM since. 

(i) Popular sovereignty ⇒ elite dictatorship ⇒ risk of populism undermining good chap culture 
(ii) Necessity of more checks ⇒ possible reform of the HoL
