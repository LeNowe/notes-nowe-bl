- [ ] Voir les mots de vocabulaire
***
shutdown = failure to enact a finance law in Parliament 
dissensus in Congress and debates about the war in Ukraine
« continuing resolution » 
1870 : Act restricting government expenditure = make sure it is financed by tax/debt 
1884 : Anti-deficiency Act
3 total shutdowns 
1st during Reagan ( 1 day )
1990 during Bush 
2013 during Obama about the Obamacare 
2018 : Partial shutdown during Trump although Rep majority in the House and in the Senate so strong dissensus among the Republican party  
The aim 

⚠ les concepts généraux ne prennent pas d’article <strike>the</strike> Defense/Obamacare ( exception = <u>the</u> Press )
To accuse somebody of doing something 
Empêcher quelqu’un de faire quelque chose = to prevent someone to do something 
a **me**chanism 
to oc**c**ur 
<strike>both</strike> the houses car « both » ( va dans le m̂ sens )

real cause = dissensus among Republican members of the House of Representatives 

## What is a shutdown ?

- A shutdown happens when the **Parliament fails to vote the budget to finance its own legislation !** ⇒ government runs out of money ⇒ **discretionary spending** interrupted ( not defense and social insurance ). They are relatively common. They are longer and longer ( 1 → 35 days ) = political consensus is getting harder to make. 
- 22 shutdowns + lot of **debt ceiling crises** ( risk of total default ⇒ meltdown of the global economy but never happened because Congress always votes a raise of the ceiling  )
- **1917** : creation of a debt ceiling ( context WWI )
- A shutdown seems to be an **outlandish way of behaving**. 
- Now, **shutdown and debt ceilings crisis are becoming more common = symptom of a malfunction of US’s institutions** 

## 1995’s v. 2023’s shutdowns

- **Weaponisation of government funding** ⇒ a **chicken game** ( ⇒ risk of miscalculation and accidental default ). Two criteria ending the game = 1) risk aversion 2) public opinion. 
- **1995** : first long shutdown Bill CLINTON v. Republican Congress behind Newt GINGRICH ( refuse the budget unless CLINTON accepts big budget cuts in Welfare, Medicare, Medicaid ). But public opinion blamed the Republicans so they gave up. It seemed to be a rational political manoeuvre with a clear purpose. 
- **2023** : risk of shutdown = Biden v. Rep House ( Kevin McCARTHY ). The Rep want to cut only discretionary spending = kind of a non-sense without clear purpose. But the problem is that **the Federal government is nothing more than an insurance company with an army**.

## The House Freedom Causus and the Republican Party 

- The responsible of the shutdown are the members of the **House Freedom Caucus** ( = extremists rep ) like Paul GOSAR, Marr GAETZ, Marjorie Taylor GREEN, who believes in PizzaGate, QAnon and white genocide ( = **far-fetched conspiracy theories** ). They are in total 45/222 Republicans in the House. Here **the frange controls the majority**. 
- Reminder : HofR = 435 → absolute majority = 218. The Rep facing mad extremist could make an alliance with moderate Democrats. But very hard compromise. 
- **To tail wagging the dog** : la queue remue le chien = la minorité impose ses choix à la majorité.
- Why ? We can say that **republicans politicians are frightened of losing the support of Trumpist activists**. But why again ? **Primary election matters more than the real elections** for Republicans. 
- 40/435 districts are competitive due to **gerrymandering** ( = redrawing the electoral map in order to maximise the odds that your party will win ) ⇒ accountability to primary voters not to all voters.
- Today **fewer centrists and more extremists** = effect of the **partisan media** polarising public opinion ( ≠ social media because the more extremist are the elderly people). 
## Political polarisation in the United States 

- **Radicalisation** of the Republican party yes but also in the Democrats’ side ! 
- Mainly on the **cultural level** ⇒ some stances became mainstream <u>Ex</u> : transgender’s rights, institutional racism 
- Also in the **economic level** → the term « socialist » is more and more accepted. <u>Ex</u> : E. WARREN and B. SANDERS received a lot of support. 
- But **asymmetrical polarisation** : both parties have drifted away from the center but not to the same extent ! 
- **Pre-2022** : Democrats = thin majority in the HoR ⇒ needed the support of « **the squad** » = people gravitating around Alexandria OCASIO CORTEZ. They used power but only for **legislative wins**. 
- VS today : Rep extremists don’t want to govern 
- But still **financial problems** : the level of the Fed debt = **120% of GDP** and a deficit of 7% of GDP = high deficit has been normalised and nobody cared because interest rate ≈ 0% But now it seems less sustainable. But US **↗ future spending** (ageing society + green transition).
