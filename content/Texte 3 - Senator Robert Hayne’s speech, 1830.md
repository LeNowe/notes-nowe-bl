# Texte 3 et 4  - Senator Robert Hayne v. Daniel Webster 
***
- A text about the **functioning of federalism** opposing **states’ rights V.S federal power**. Who’s gonna be the arbiter ? 
- ⚠ A text between 1820s → 1960s about the functioning of federalism = facade to debate about the status of black people ! Why ? Because defending explicitly slavery seems to be not compatible with America’s founding values. But on the institutional level it’s ok, you’re defending the states’ freedom ! 
- ⚠ The South ≠ geographical identity but = the states that seceded in 1860-61 
## <u>I. Senator Robert Hayne’s speech</u>

**A cultural sectionalism** 
- HAYNE denounces a protectionist tax created in **1838** by the **Jacksonian Democrats** ( they realised that America’s industry had to develop and feared that the country will be uncompetitive ) to catch up with Britain’s industry ⇒ **high tariff on foreign imports**. 
- According to HAYNE the tax will ruin the South ⇒ ⚠ **retaliatory tariffs** on America’s exports = « **King Cotton** ». So JACKSON’s tariff became the « **the tariff of abomination** » ⇒ South unable to export cotton ⇒ some planters would go bankrupt ⇒ what to do with the surplus of slaves ? ( freedom ? omg ) ⇒ **black rebellions** ( = southerners fantasy ) cf. **1822** : Denmark Vesey’s rebellion. 
- HAYNE describe a **southern character** based on an **aristocratic romanticism** ( nobility, generosity, idealism, love of liberty ( = *clichés* at that time and survived until the 1960s ) ≠ **norther character** based on **utilitarianism** ( « cold and calculating prudence » of the North ).
- Southern people claimed that slavery should be seen as one mode among as several of way to regulate relations between employers and employees. Yes, the planters are the « **lords of the lash** » but norther factory managers where « **lords of the loom** ». They claimed that slaves were better than the North proletariat. Slaves ∈ **extented family circle** = **slavery as a paternalistic system**. 

| Southern character       | Northern character    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Aristocratic romanticism | Utilitarianism        |
| « Lords of the lash »    | « Lords of the loom » |
| Permanent relation       | Short-term contracts  |
| The car you own          | The car you rent      |

- But if you have two nations is it possible to avoid secession ? 

### B ) Consolidation v. nullification 

- HAYNE considers that the tariff against the Constitution of the United States
- **Federalism is an illusion** and federal state is above states. He points out that the Supreme Court is a branch of the Fed government ⇒ states’s sovereignty < federal sovereignty. 
- So **check and balances** is a joke = « This is a practically a ‘‘government without limitation of powers’’» ⇒ risk of authoritarian state ( cf. antifed fears during the debates on the Constitution ). 
- The states have a duty to resort to **nullification** ( = interposition ) = theory according to which the sates have the right to interpose their sovereignty between the federal government and their citizens.
- To legitimate his pov he refers to the **Virginia and Kentucky resolutions** drafted by MADISON & JEFFERSON against the Alien & Sedition Acts  cf. [[Texte 6 - Kentucky Resolutions ( 1798 )]]. Like them his defence of nullification = « **defence of the status quo** ». 
- Ref to John HAMPDEN = British politician active in the 1<sup>st</sup> ½ of the 17<sup>th</sup> especially during the conflict between king Charles I ( = authoritarian monarchy ) V.S Parliament ( = parliamentary monarchy ). Wanted to create new taxes but Parliament refused ⇒ decided to interpretate freely existing ones. HAMPDEN led the opposition ⇒ **1640s** : English Civil War → **1649** : Abolition of the monarchy & beheading of Charles I. This reference = **threat of violence**. 

## <u>II. Daniel Webster’s response to Hayne</u>

D. WEBSTER = norther senator. Here he is formally answering to HAYNE but also to J.C CALHOUN ( vice-pre of the US = pdt of the Senate in favour of nullification ). 

⚠ « honorable gentleman » ≠ mark of respect but formal expression 
WEBSTER rephrase HAYNE’s speech = « any state, in any case, can nullify any federal decision » = parti of the C° ≠ challenge ⇒ dissolves union & replaces with a confederation 

**Problem of federalism** = what happens when the two holders of sovereignty are in conflict ⇒ no arbitration possible ! 

- If ( States ⇒ Fed Gvt ) ⇒ ≈ system of devolution *i.e* the Fed Gvt is States’ tool 
- If ( People ⇒ Fed Gvt ) ⇒ only the people can control the Fed Gvt 
- For HAYNE the **Fed Gvt derives its authority to the people** ! cf. « We, the people of the United States » and not « We, the states ». 

**The arbiter between states and Federal state is the people**. Sovereignty belongs to the people.The states have to acknowledge its will. 

> We are all agents of the same supreme power, the people. The general government and the State governments derive their authority from the same source. 

10th Amendment rephrased in l.29 

But in practice **how can the people arbitrates and imposes its will** ? 
- **Vote** 
- **Judicial avenue** → SC ( theoretically the people can also get rid of a justice with vast majorities in the House and in the Senate = practically impossible… ).

The **whole constitutional dispute is a facade**. The end of the two texts evokes the dangerous possibility of a civil war. 

The **crisis was defused** through Pst Andrew JACKSON by : 
- Maintaining the tariff 
- Decreasing economic pain 

The **nullification crisis ended in 1832**.

- to equate X with Y = (  to say that X = Y )
- to resort 
- far fetched = tiré par les cheveux 
- désigner, nommer = nominate 
- to defuse = désamorcer une crise
