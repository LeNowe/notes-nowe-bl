# Texte 24 - Nixon, *Silent majority speech* 
***
## Introduction 

**Richard Nixon ( 1913-1994 )** 
- Born in California to Quaker parents who had moved from the Middle West. Humble background. 
- Went to a Quaker school, had outstanding results. Then attended Duke Law School with a scholarship, graduated in 1937. 
- Married Catherine (Pat) Ryan in 1940. 2 daughters. 
- Worked in the wartime Office of Price Administration, then served in the Navy in the South Pacific. Rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. 

**1946** : elected US Representative of California, defeating a 5-term Democrat. Took part in the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Played a key role in ending the career of ALGER HISS (a top State Department civil servant), accusing him of having communist connections. Proposed the Mundt-Nixon Bill, requiring communist organizations and individuals to register with the government. Blocked in the Senate. Then Nixon kept his distance from McCARTHY. 

**1950** : **elected US Senator of California**. To be elected, he accused his opponent of communist leanings, which got him the reputation of a ruthless polarizer ready to do anything to win. 

**1952** : chosen as EISENHOWER’s running mate for the Presidential election. Faced suspicion that wealthy businessmen had set up a secret fund to promote his career. The accusation jeopardized his nomination on the Presidential ticket. To defend himself and save his career, he went on TV and made a speech in which he denied benefiting from any gift, except for a spaniel dog named Checkers that a supporter had offered and that his daughter would keep. The speech is known as the **Checkers speech** ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9LcAJOsFGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9LcAJOsFGg)). **Remained Vice-President for 8 years**. 

He was first rather poorly considered by EISENHOWER, who kept him away from his inner circle, gave him few responsibilities and even sometimes humiliated him in public. 

But when EISENHOWER had some health issues (1955-1957), he showed tact and restraint and fulfilled the duties of the President (presiding over numerous cabinet meetings and National Security Council meetings) in a manner that gained him some respect. 

During these 8 years, he relentlessly campaigned for both moderate and conservative Republicans. He attacked the Democratic presidential candidate ADLAI STEVENSON in 1952 and 1956. 

He supported the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (establishing a Civil Rights Commission to protect the voting rights of minorities). 

He supported the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (Federal funding for science research programs). 

In **1959**, he went to the Soviet Union and took part in a debate with KHRUSHCHEV in the context of an exhibition promoting the ways of life of both the US and the USSR. Boosted his popularity. 

**1960** : **won the nomination of the Republican party but was defeated by KENNEDY** by a very small margin in the popular vote (about 100,000 votes out of 70 million). Was impaired by a disastrous performance in a television debate organised between the two candidates. KENNEDY appeared more youthful, representing a new generation. 

**1961** : worked as a lawyer in New York; published a political memoir entitled *Six Crises*. 

**1962** : **ran for Governor of California but was defeated**. Was convinced that the media were against him and had managed to put an end his career (second major defeat in a couple of years). He told reporters: “**You don’t have Nixon to kick around any more**” ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya1GWB2AMnY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya1GWB2AMnY)) 

Still continued to campaign for Republican candidates across the country. Played a centrist role after the defeat of the arch-conservative BARRY GOLDWATER against JOHNSON in 1964 (27 million votes v 43 million; 52 Electors v 486 Electors). 

**1968** : **incredible comeback; managed to win the Republican nomination**. Faced a Democratic Party divided over the Vietnam war and shaken by demonstrations at its Chicago convention. **Won over HERBERT HUMPRHEYS** ( JOHNSON had decided to withdraw from the race, one of the favourite candidates being ROBERT KENNEDY, who was assassinated just after winning the California primary ). 

Nixon had gathered a coalition of northern blue-collar workers and southern whites. He had campaigned as a law and order candidate who would quell domestic protests and end the Vietnam war. 

Policy : 
- increased social security benefits
- expanded the Jobs Corps
- introduced quotas for minorities to have access to skilled jobs
- created the Environment Protection Agency 
- increased the Federal deficit, first to finance JOHNSON’s Great Society, then to finance the war without raising taxes
- opposed school busing
- opposed the extension of the 1965 Civil RIghts Act
- slowed down school integration 
- unsuccessfully nominated two southern conservatives to the Supreme Court (CLEMENT HAYNSWORTH, HARROLD CARSWELL), but made four appointments during his terms: WARREN BURGER, HARRY BLACKMUN, LEWIS POWELL, WILLIAM REHNQUIST
- developed a policy of détente with America’s cold war adversaries. Visited China, signed an agreement to promote cooperation with the USSR (science, technology, health, environment, space), signed an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT1). Thought this détente policy would improve chances for a favourable Vietnam settlement. But the conflict dragged on and led to a North Vietnamese victory. 
- involvement of the US to overthrow the democratically elected president of Chile SALVADOR ALLENDE. 

**1972** : **reelected by a landslide** against GEORGE McGOVERN (an anti-war Democrat). 520 Electoral votes v 17. 

**1973** : **his Vice-President SPIRO AGNEW resigned** amid charges of tax evasion and accepting bribes. Replaced by GERALD FORD (Speaker of the House). 

His second term was plagued by **the Watergate scandal**, revealed by two Washington Post journalists: CARL BERNSTEIN and BOB WOODWARD, helped by a mole from the FBI referred to as **“Deep Throat”** (actually an FBI associate director). 

Investigations led by a Special Prosecutor, first ARCHIBALD COX, then LEON JAWORSKI. 

The existence of tapes recording conversations in the Oval Office was revealed. But NIXON refused to deliver them all, claiming the privilege of the executive. But the Supreme Court ruled against him in US v Nixon (1974). 

An impeachment procedure was launched. 

**Aug. 9th, 1974**: **resigned his office (the only President to do so)**. His departure from the White House has become iconic ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTFsoElX-a0)) and often parodied ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SXBZfzc1Dc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SXBZfzc1Dc)). 

GERALD FORD became the first non-elected President. 

Sept. 1974 : **received full pardon** from FORD. 

Then spent the rest of his life working to rehabilitate his reputation, through books, series of interviews (esp. with DAVID FROST: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhdewyMSeJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhdewyMSeJI)), lectures.**

## Analysis 

- beginning of polarization : breaking with consensus 
- condescent and pragmatic approach 
- dismissing the political approach of the « vocal minority » 
- federalist point of view 
- authoritarian conception of the executive power 
- emotionnel and personnal argument 
- disguizing polarizing speech behind the original values of the US 
- media are controlled by liberals 

**1936** : US v CURTIS-WRIGHT stated that the President was the only one responsible for foreign policy.
