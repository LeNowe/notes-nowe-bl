# Strikes in the US
***
## <u>The reasons of an historical decline</u>

Currently, more strikes than usual in the United States. Why ? 
- People’s **purchasing power has gone down** and people started to struggle to make ends meet 
- Very **low unemployment rate**. Workers are in a good position to struggle. 
- The stock market is doing very well but the **working class is not benefiting from the growth**. 

**In opinion polls Unions have a better image nowadays than a decade ago**. ⚠ It doesn't mean that unions are powerful. Indeed, fewer people in unions and almost only from public sectors… It has been a **long time decline since the mid 1950s** (decline of the industrial class, fewer blue collars, ID less centred on job). But the same phenomenons occurred in Canada but the unionisation rate had not fallen. What happened ? 

**It’s not a disease, it is a murder**. 

**Political decisions crushed the Unions**. ⚠ No « welfare state » in US. Only **social safety net** = ungenerous version of the Welfare State. 
- **1935** : the ***Wagner Act*** legitimated the presence of unions in the workplace.. It guarantees the right of private sector employees to organise into trade unions, engage in collective bargaining, and take collective action such as strikes. 
- **1947** : the ***Taft Hartley Act***  passed by the Rep majority in Congress under Truman (Dem) who failed to veto this anti-union Act. Empower the states to pass « **right-to-work » legislation** ≈ right to outlaw the practise of the « **closed shop** » (= closed workshop). It **discourages unionisation**.

**The decline of unions matters ⇒ ↗ social inequalities** ! Possible correlation between the share of income going to the top 10 percent and the decline of Union membership. Also strong **correlation between Republican states and states with « right-to-work » legislation**. If we assume there is no hidden factor we have a chicken and egg question. 

Media attention devoted to attempts to increase unionisation in Starbucks and Amazon. It is very confrontational. To acknowledge the legitimacy of the creation of a union each cafe or warehouse must vote for it. Employers fight against and trie to intimidate their workers. 

- **1981** : The **air traffic controller’s strike** ( = public workers not allowed to strike ) REAGAN’s government showed that it was willing to risk a lot to weaken and destroy unions. The 13 000 strikers thought they were in a good position. REAGAN told them to go back to work otherwise they would be fired. 12 000 still were striking. He fired all of them. 

## <u>Biden and strikes</u>

**He proclaimed that he was the most union-friendly president of the US**. He appointed members of the *National Labour Board* (= federal entity to enforce labour law) and went on a picket. 

However there are limits. He has to stay sufficiently popular ! In **December 2022** **workers in the rail industry threatened to strike**. But Biden managed to act against the union by forbidding the strike.  

But **how to react to the strike just launched by** **UAW** ( = *Union of the automobile workers* ) ? 150 000 workers from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis went on strike for better pay and protested against the rise of electric vehicles. **BIDEN went to their picket**. However, Biden passed the ***Inflation Reduction Act*** that aims to facilitate the energy transition and US protectionism ( ⇒ subsidies for automobile company ).
