# The mug shot and trumpism
***
Donald TRUMP’s mug shot. He has been accused of 91 distinct crimes. The mug shot is in association with **racketeering** in relation with the vote count in the state of Georgia during the 2021 election. « **Find me 6 000 votes** ». 

It is not a **candid picture** but a posed picture. He chose his hostile expression. **The mug shot became a shot on mugs**. Within 19 minutes the picture was on sale on a coffee mug on Trump’s campaign site ⇒ **24h = 7m $ of goodies**. Other t-shirt with a crown. Sticker « Trump was right about everything » = **personality cult**. 

Trump is presented as **the people’s champion** but also **embodying the people** ⇒ **government by Trump is government by the people** = true democracy. This conception is at the core of **populism**. 

> They’re not after me, they’re after you…I’m just standing in the way ! – Trump’s website 

The « **They** » = the democrats but also the civil service, the justice system, the **deep state** = idea that in appearance power is democratically gifted but that the substance of power belongs to non-elected people ( army, civil servants, secret services but also mainstream liberal medias ). 

**No detail platform on the website**. Instead **accusations of corruption** = t-shirt of Joe and Hunter Biden. How awful the alternative is. But vagueness of the accusation « Nation in decline » (corruption or incompetence ?). « Joe Biden owes me gas money » = Joe Biden is blamed for inflation. But actually the responsible is the market’s price. 

**Blind following of a leader** = **trumpism**. 

But Trump is not an ordinary american. He is a billionaire who inherited his money from Fred Trump, a property developer [promoteur]. He eventually squandered the family fortune = **degenerated aristocratic**. Donald TRUMP’s business is **branding** = purely image associated with luxury. 

> I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t loose any voters, ok ? 

According to Jerry FALWELL Jr called Trump « **America’s blue collar billionaire** ». In terms of his way of expression and being his seems to belong to the working class. As a young man he used to talk with white workers. **Inarticulate speech** as far as it could be from official speech. The message is « **I’m not part of the elite** ». 

Why the American working class is supporting Trump’s discourse ? 
- They are not benefiting from growth. Their **purchasing power has hardly budged**.
- The U.S is no more acknowledged as the world’s policeman. Feeling of decline. 
- The U.S is set to become a **majority minority country** by 2050. White will be a <u>relative</u> majority. 

But from an evangelical view point Trump does not embody traditional morality…How evangelical Americans still support him ? For **pragmatic reasons** to achieve certain ends <u>Ex</u> : abortion. 

Trump’s electorate is composite. 

**Prisoners = the Republican establishment can’t break from him**. Trump made a **hostile takeover** in 2016. But nowadays better unity. 

⚠ Elephant = Republican Party and Donkey = Democrats 

> [!abstract] To sum up !
> To sum up Trump’s composite supports
> - **Trumpism**’s support from the middle class fearing America’s decline 
> - **Pragmatism** of evangelical people
> - The **prisoners** from the Republican establishment
> 

Normally if you want to win an election you need to : 
- Mobilise your base 
- Conquer **swing voters** or purple voter 

But **Trump is not a asset to conquer swing voters**. In 2022 mid-terms Republican does not big win. McConnell complains about « candidate quality ». Normally the Republican party should choice a more moderate candidate. But who’s ahead in the national polls ? More of 50% of Republican activists say Trump. **A lot of career politicians dislike Trump and his ideas and yet are prisoners of Trump’s popularity**. **The party is trumped !** 

Next election = probably new TRUMP V.S BIDEN : 
- If Biden elected the Republican party may move away from populism. 
- If Trump wins democracy may died or a point of no return will be reached.
