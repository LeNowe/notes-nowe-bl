# Purdue Pharma Settlement and the opioids epidemic
***
- Bankruptcy 
- SC ruling 
- The opioid epidemic : used as pain killer but also as a drug ⇒ overdoses ⇒ job shortage 
- Oxycontin ⇒ Purdue Pharma sued 
- Describing as an epidemic = drug addicts are victim not criminals 

⚠ Be cautions on Big Pharma : yes opioid crisis but also COVID vaccine ! 

**A weird demographic decline for a western country cause by overdoses** 
- 50k overdoses/year in 2015 ↗ 100k in 2021 
- Over the last 10 years over 600k Americans died of an overdoses // Vietnam war = 58k ✞ 
- So massive that it effects life expectancy ( declining just before COVID )
- Among others **deaths of despair** ( alcoholism, suicide )
- ⅔ of drugs overdoses = opioids 
- Now **combination of cocaine with opioids** 

Normally big gap between natives/blacks and whites. But **anormal amount of whites overdoses** ⇒ « epidemic » and not « crisis » according to the politicians. **Mostly men between 35-64 years old**. **That’s odd** : why an experienced drug addict would take the wrong dosage ? 

Today, the killer is mainly **fentanyl** ( more than **heroin** ). But there are **three stages of the epidemic** : 
- insérer schéma diapo 

It became in **rural America** among popular workers with chronic pain = **hillbilly overdoses** in the Appalachians with **pharmaceutical pills** = **opioid-based painkillers** like Oxycontin . But it happened to be addictive ⇒ ↗ doses ⇒ moved to the black market to seek heroin then fentanyl.  

**Purdue Pharma is not the only one. But it is a family business** ( ≠ shareholder business ) owned by the SACKLER family. So easier to blame real persons. Purdue Pharma lobbied doctors and claimed it was not addictive. 

**Fentanyl is a powerful drug** ≈ 100 × powerful than morphine ⇒ dosage is tricky. 

**It all started with backaches and a lie**… 

In **2007** : Purdue Pharma fined by government for $ 500m for misrepresenting risks of Oxycontin. So **everybody knew** and Purdue Pharma made money on people’s overdoses. 

They have been lawsuits by families and NGOs. But there hasn’t been a trial but a **settlement** of $6 billions. Why a settlement rather than a trial ? Because phenomenal legal cost of the trial + no clue of the issue.  And the firm has not to confess her guilt. Accepted by victims because the SACKLER family had emptied accounts (to send their money to tax havens. 

**Purdue Pharma has a respectable image** ( subsidise the MET, Oxford, etc. ).

The photographer Nan GOLDIN ( who was also addict to Oxycontin ) organised « **Die in** » at museums ⇒ get rid of SACKLER’s money.

## Drug policies in US 

**1971** : NIXON declared a « War on drugs » ( Vietnam veteran that became addicted to heroin ) = repression of traffic and users. 

**1980s** : « **Three strikes and you’re out** » policy. Local policy used in California ⇒ prison to life. Should be a deterrent. **Surprise it doesn’t work !** and ↘ price of drug. 

Politicians from all parties now seem to understand that **repression doesn’t work**. Drugs like marihuana were decriminalised ( everything in Oregon !! ⇒ not working ). **Decriminalisation doesn’t work**. 

Policies of **mitigation/abatement** = limiting the risk of deaths ⇒ **restaurants have Naloxone** ( = antidote ). But it doesn’t work if the opioid is mixed with horse tranquilliser… And providing **test kits** to know what are you consuming. **This is the best on offer and it’s not great…**
