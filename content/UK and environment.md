# UK, nature and the environment 
***
**1938** : 
**2001** : Climate change levy
**2008** : Climate change Act = lower emissions, voted by almost all MPs 
**2019** : carbon neutrality 2050
**2020** : Ultra-low emission zone in London
became a bipartisan issue 
national legislation
what about UE environment policies after Brexit ? 
King Charles = ecologist on a reactionary mode 
SUNAK = lack of ecologic leadership 

## <u>I. Rishi Sunak’s U-turn ?</u>

« Sunak ‘‘back drivers’’ wth curbs on 20mph limits and bus lanes » in September 2023. He denounces « **anti-car measures** » ( ≈ écologie punitive ) But he’s denouncing laws passed by the Conservative majorities =a **U-turn** !! Both parties now endorses the need to make environment friendly policies. 

**Desperate speech** because polls are announcing a Labour landslide = **historic defeat for the Conservatives** ( worse than 1997 ). But in **1997** there was a momentum for Labour. But this year there isn’t. Keir STARMER ≠ man with a vision ⇒ no Labour victory but Conservative defeat !

In a constituency near London, the Conservatives won. They think part of the electorate was very anger against the Ultra Low Emissions Zone and deduce that a anti-green speech will work. 

But it is not an absolue U-turn. The Climate change Act will not be repealed. He says let’s **de-prioritise pollution issues**. 

## <u>II. Historical perspective</u>

### A ) Nature and environment

⚠ **nature** ( = free from human presence ) ≠ **environment** ( in Anthropocene ). UK was well-placed to know the predominance of environment. Britain saw first the **consequences of industrialisation and urbanisation**. Let’s see the history of that shift. 

For a long-time, the dominant idea was that man was lost in a **pristine nature** perceived negatively. 

Hector St JOHN DE CREVECOEUR, *Letters from an American Farmer*, 1782 =  negative description of the frontier = **collapse of the civilisation in the woods**. 

The **countryside** ( fields mainly ) is perceived in a proto-romantic love of nature = health and virtue & rejection of the city’s ill. 

> God made the country, and man made the town. – « The Task », William COWPER, 1785

With **Romanticism** came the temptation to worship nature. William WORDSWORTH ( 1<sup>st</sup> ½ of the 19<sup>th</sup> ) made the Lake District popular. He published in **1810** ***Guide to the Lakes*** = important date in the history of tourism. He was disillusioned about French R° ⇒ about Enlightenment ideas generally. He turned reactionary and found that nature was great. **Transcendentalist** conception of man ( ≈ Rousseau ). Essentially this praise of nature is a **reaction against the city** ≈ form of nostalgia. 

> The Child is father of the Man. 

US = 1<sup>st</sup> country to **create national parks** ( **1872** : Yosemite and **1890** : Yellowstone and closure of the frontier ) cf. picture of ROOSEVELT with John MUIR. 

But in Britain most of the land was private ⇒ difficult to create National parks. But after WWII ATLEE gov created England’s « **green belts** » (areas around cities not to be built) = create recreational areas for people in the cities. But housing issues now…  

### B ) Environmentalism

#### 1. In the US

- **1962** : *Silent spring* by Rachel CARLSON, american biologist → silent because DDT ( = pesticide ) poisoned and killed bees. 
- **1970** : Creation of the **EPA (= Environmental Protection Agency)** under NIXON ( still a bipartisan thing ! ). 

#### 2. In the UK 

- **1952** : *The **Great Smog*** in London ( smoke + fog ) ⇒ at least 12k ✞ 
- **1956** : **Clean Air Act** = banned the dirtiest form of coal heating 

### C ) Britain and climate change 

- **2021** : BJ announced a plan according to which Britain would reach ***net zero* by 2050** and that Britain would use **only sustainable electricity by 2035**. 

Indeed BJ was a statist conservative <u>Ex</u> : « levelling up » agenda = bringing poor norther England at southern England’s level by. BJ indulged in « **boosterism** » (great plans without wondering how to make them happen). 

To clean up the carbon footprint UK **get rid of coal energy**. It was helped by much cheaper renewable energy <u>Ex</u> : **offshore wind turbines** = 1<sup>st</sup> country to commit to **legally-binding** carbon reduction = unanimously voted. 

Britain did most of work for electricity ( easy you change a carbon power plant in a renewable power plant ). But now **further reductions are getting hard to achieve especially in heating and in transport** ⇒ impact individuals ( insulation work in people’s property and anti-car measures ) ⇒ ↗ costs that **could antagonise public opinion**.
