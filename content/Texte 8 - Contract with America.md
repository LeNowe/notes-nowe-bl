# Contract with America
***
**⇒ 1992’s presidential election** : 
- **Ross PEROT** (3rd party candidate) ⇒ 19% of the popular vote 
	- He was a billionaire populist 
	- Against NAFTA
	- ↗ income tax and capital gains tax (speculation and rentier behavior)
	- ↘ small businesses’ taxes 
	- More direct democracy 
	- He split the republican vote (took votes from **BUSH** rather than **CLINTON**)
- CLINTON « **It’s the economy stupid** » (blaming BUSH’s management of the economy) ⇒ he embodied New Democrats 
- **CLINTON won but Rep make sure that he couldn’t govern** 
	- End ban on gays serving in the army ⇒ replaced by « **don’t ask, don’t tell » policy**
	- Healthcare reform ⇒ gave job to Hillary CLINTON (≠ nepotism, she was efficient) to introduce universel coverage but denounced by Rep ⇒ it failed 

**1994** = **midterm elections, Rep had bounced back = « Republicans Revolution »** (end of more than 40 years of Democratic Congress) ⇒ **watershed event in America’s politics (beginning of polarisation)**
- Influence of Newt GINGRICH (man of the year in 1995)
- They managed to win a majority !

**In the text, nothing new in term of core policy. But populist rhetoric !** 

## <u>I. Restoring power to the people</u>

### A ) The power of incumbents 

- **1918-1990s : the House was dominated by the Dem (and also Senate to a smaller extent)** 
	- New Deal Coalition = extremely effective to secure votes 
- The text calls for a **legislative line-item veto** = **desire to fight again « pork barrel politics »** (≈ clientelism + « cavalier législatif »)

### B ) Profiteering Congressmen

- **Committee = group of congressmen** specialised on one topic (≈ commission parlementaire)
- Denouncing proxy vote (⇒ being member of committee (higher wage + staff) without doing the work

### C ) Empowering citizens 

- Presenting themselves as **outsiders** 
- **Reducing the gap between population and politicians** 
- « Contract with America » ⇒ promise to **remain accountable** 
- **Nationalisation of politics** ≠ juxtaposition of separate local debates 

## <u>II. Appealing to a traditional Republican coalition</u>

### A ) Tough on crime 

- Policy prioritise repression ⇒ unwilling to consider social determinations 
- The name also = « **Taking Back Our Streets Act** » ⇒ whites taking back control over blacks perceived as dangerous 
- Partly, behind this are facts (↗ murder rate) but popular culture’s representations = out of proportion <u>Ex</u> : movies with vigilante = *Batman, Robocop* 
- **1992** : **Los Angeles riots** = context of high institutional racism. Rodney KING = African-American taxi driver driving too fast and chased by the police ⇒ he was beaten up by the police in front of security cameras (was not resisting arrest) ⇒ sued the police department, they were found innocent by a jury (all whites)
- **The Southern strategy = a dog-whistle policy** (only racists can hear these messages)
- « **The welfare queen** » = single black mother benefiting from welfare programs (producing extra-children perceived as a way to increase your income) ⇒ inspired by Linda TAYLOR = welfare fraud ⇒ drive in Cadillac (but she was the only one…)

### B ) Strengthening the family

**Appealing to traditionalists = the Christian Right** (= evangelicals + traditionalist Catholics)
- Marriage 
- Denouncing an excessive secularised education (ENGEL v. VITALI)
- Anti-pornography laws 

But **in the 1970s evangelicals did not automatically vote for the Rep** (**1976** : CARTER = Dem + evangelical). 

**1980s** : **REAGAN got the support of Jerry FALWELL’s « Moral Majority »**

### C ) Restoring personal responsibility 

**Will to replace welfare programs by family solidarity** 

**A low tax agenda** = in line with Rep orthodoxy since REAGAN denouncing a « big state » = « **the government is not the solution to your problems, the government is the problem** » ⇒ « tax relief »

**1978** : **California’s « Proposition 13 »** (under governor REAGAN)
- Slash state taxes 
- Tax increases cannot be increased without ⅔ of majority (to make sure the cuts will not be undone)

Influence of **the Heritage Foundation** (American big business think tank)

## <u>III. Demagogic deception</u>

### A ) Refashioning the role of Congressmen

- ∅ will to find bipartisan compromise 
- Congressmen = transmission belt for legislative texts that the public wants ≈ direct democracy 

### B ) The over-simplifications of common sense 

- « Common Sense Legal Reform Act »
- The state has to balance its budget the same way that a family has to 
- Willful ignorance of the complexity of economic policy 
- Welfare = system of incentives creating free-riders 
- Using key words to attract voters <u>Ex</u> : ***Language : A key mechanism of control*** (memo circulated among the Rep candidates) ≠ rational argument but **advertising technique** ⇒ polarisation is going to spiral out of control 

**1994** : **they won (so the strategy worked…)** ⇒ **became the new basis of the way of campaigning for the Rep**

- Proposition = référendum type RIP (échelle des états)
- to spin out of control = if activities or events spin out of control, they change very quickly and in an uncontrolled way:
