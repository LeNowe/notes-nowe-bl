# Samuel Smiles, *Self-help*, 1859
***
## Introduction

**⇒ The Victorian period (1837-1901)**
- **1837-1851** = doubt 
	- Liberal reforms 
	- Quick industrialisation ⇒ ↘ working class life expectancy and terrible life conditions 
	- Boom & bust economy 
	- Growing of inequalities ( cf. DISRAELI about the « two nations » )
	- Chartism 
	- **1851** : **Crystal Palace Exhibition** demonstrating Britain’s superiority + thousand of people without riot ⇒ belief that ( economic progress ⇒ social peace ) 
- **1851-1873** = social peace and optimism 
- **1873-1901** ( ✞ Queen Victoria ) or **1914** = doubt again 
	- ↘ Economic situation 
	- Britain ceased to be in the lead in technology 
	- Exaggerated decline 
	- **1870** : Franco-German War ⇒ Germany emerged as a potential competitor 

**⇒ SMILES, *Self-Help*, 1859**
- SMILES = embodiment of great mid-Victorian period 
- Collection of biographies of great men ( soldiers, scientist ) 
- Individualism + very dismissive of external circumstances 

**Utilitarianism** 
- Pleasure v. Pain ⇒ amoral 
- U<sub>society</sub> = Σ U<sub>individual</sub>

SMILES fall into oblivion in the 1900s because his ideas appeared antiquated with the growth of state intervention. But *Self-Help* was published again in **1980s** with the rise of THATCHER. It was prefaced by Keith JOSEPH, THATCHER’s mentor. 

## <u>I. No such thing as society</u>

### A ) A gospel of individualism 

- Methodological individualism <u>Ex</u> : Poor Law Amendment Act
- JS-MILL’s quotation ( ⚠ reminder : JS MILL was the son of BENTHAM’s secretary )

### B ) A night-watchman government 

- The government cannot improve anything by legislation and is often counterproductive 
- BENTHAM’s notion of felicific calculus 
- Government intervention crowds out individual effort ⇒ state intervention encourages laziness 
- Government should just protect LOCKE’s natural rights 
## <u>II. An apparently <strike>conservative</strike> unprogressive creed</u>

### A ) Common sense v. progressive hopes

- Franchise reform is a waste of time 
- Defender of the status quo 
- Younger SLILES was a racial implied in Chartism but he became aware that masses were too poorly educated to vote ⇒ became suspicious of utopianism 
- Pragmatism ( « Heaven helps those who help themselves » = well-tried maxim )
- No interest in academic education ( because abstract ideas ≠ daily life experience )

### B ) Happy be the workers 

- Emphasis on character = mid-Victorian ideology 
- Because high concentrated population ⇒ huge risk of friction 
- Perseverance and discipline 
- // with Thomas CARLYLE’s ( = scottish ) « gospel of work »
- « with Will one can don anything » = proto-social Darwinism 

## <u>III. A Victorian morality : rehabilitating the community</u>

### A ) Challenging individualism 

- JS MILL’s quotation ( ⚠ careful he’s nuanced and uneasy to criticise cf. « Better Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied » )
- MILL’s biography : child prodigy raised on the basis utilitarianism but depressed at the age of 18 ⇒ saved by W. WORDSWORTH’s poetry ( praise of nature )« Better Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied »
- Conservative aspects : gives a lot of value to improvements made by the past ⇒ present generation custodian of previous achievements = mid-Victorian ideology accepting the coexistence of two incompatible ideologies 

### B )  A comparatively egalitarian vision 

- Putting on the same level people from different social class 
- Cult of success and self-made men 
- Yes, the elite’s governing but is following the dominant rules of society 
- Against the idea of supernatural heroes ( CARLYLE, *On heroes, hero-worship, and the heroic in history*, 1841 )
- ⚠ But for SMILES evangelicalism > utilitarianism ( = strange cocktail ! ) ⇒ the individual has to be capable of reforming himself 
- Great men are « valuable examples » ( do the same ≠ obey blindly ) = approchable figures 
- Personal qualities ( perseverance = most ⚠ ) → Wealth and social status 

## Conclusion 

- SMILES’s belief in self-improvement was widely accepted by the underprivileged themselves 
- *Self-help* = series of lecture delivered to working class association ( on their demand ! )
- ⚠ Au XIXème la religion ça compte !! 

***
- A night-watchman government ≠ the nanny state 
- A de**fen**der 
- **1867** : « The Leap in the dark » = 2<sup>nd</sup> Reform Act 
-  utopianism 
- BENTHAM’s panopticon : prison first but intended to extend it to schools, hospitals, etc. 
- Evangelicalism = 2<sup>nd</sup> birth in Christ ( =  conscient mystical experience ⇒ the individual understand that God is always with him as an individual ) 
- Utilitarianism = « brutilitarianism » according to DISRAELI because absence of solidarity
