# Macaulay, *The Edinburgh Review*, 1828
***
## Introduction 

- **MACAULAY = MP, historian and political thinker**  
- India → « **Minute on Indian Education** » = how Indian people might be educated ? Not through any local languages ( limited, couldn’t express complex ideas ) but you can elevate them to the European level. 
- Founder of the « **Whig vision of history** »
	- Progress = + freedom & expansion of trade 
	- History = progress of reason and protestant theology 
	- Universal history ⇒ if two societies are ≠ ⇒ they are not at the same stage 
	- But possible step back ⇒ progress has to be gradual ⇒ progress has to be initiated by the elite 
- The **Great Reform Act** 
- **Defending reform with conservative arguments** = let’s reform because it is the best way to limit change ≈ BURKE ⇒ raise the question of **ideological differences between Whig and Tories**. 

## <u>I. A Constitution under Attack</u>

### A ) An unrepresentative House of Commons

- [[Britain's revolutions]] 
- 1688’s system was less and less accepted 
- ∃ gap between the « general feeling » and the Parliament 
- They were very large cities without representation = **booming industrial cities** <u>Ex</u> : Manchester = « Cottonopolis ». BUT ⚠ the electoral map was still medieval !! 
- **Rotten boroughs**  <u>Ex</u> : « Old Sarum »  = 0 inhabitant & 11 voters ⇒ **pocket boroughs** = dominated by one land-owner = easy corruption ! 
- **1830** : 140 rotten boroughs / 658 constituencies and 50 of them had fewer than 50 voters 
- ⚠ HOC = misnomer <u>Ex</u> : in 1860 ¾ of MPs ∈ Aristocracy but not peers ( Lords’ sons or inferior aristocrats ) + the gentry. 
- At that time **4% of adult population had the right to vote** ≈ the richest ( but not industrialist ) and no universal criteria… They were some rare places when working class/women could vote.  

### B ) Rising pressure for change 

- Especially concerning the status concerning religion. 
- « **Catholic claims** » *i.e* the disenfranchisement of Catholics
- **1828** : Repeal of the T&C Acts ( for Dissenters ) ⇒ Catholics wanted the same ! 
- **1815** : **Corn Laws** 
	- For : landed aristocracy 
	- Against : working class, factory owners ( because paying subsistence wages )
- « **Signs of unquiet times** » ⇒ <u><b>necessity to reform the franchise</b></u> 

### C ) Flawed responses : « demolition » and « bigotry »

- **Bigots =** **ultra non-reformist Tories** who believed that any change could lead to chaos 
- **Demolition** = innovators wanting for a President and a National Convention ≈ US’s universal suffrage of 1828 or FR in 1790s → **republicanism** = supporters of Jeremy BENTHAM 

## <u>II. To reform in order to preserve</u>

### A ) Tories cause revolutions 

- Frequently refers to **revolution as a danger** 
- **Immobilitism leads to R°** : refusing to adapt ⇒ ↗ gap with what society wants ⇒ R° 
- **Whigs vision of history** 
### B ) Preserving order by relocating the social divide 

- If you want to avoid R° you need reform 
- « **Reform that we may preserve** » 
- 4% of rich voters / poor = rich / capitalist, middle-class, working class ⇒ danger 
- Need to create a **coalition of owners defending order** ( ≠ FR where there was an alliance between the working class and the bourgeoisie ) ⇒ **the franchise has to be extended to the propertied**. 
- **Reform is the lesser evil**

## <u>III. A second Burke ?</u>

### A ) A reluctant reformer 

- The HoC is perfectly working but people don’t understand 
- **Pressure of public opinion** ⇒ inevitably not necessarily good change has to be channel 
- MACAULAY has **zero enthusiasm** 
- **The elite is forced to accept change** ≠ Whig’s vision of history 

### B ) An organic vision of society 

| Organic                                        | Mechanical                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Society = living being ( human body / tree ) | Society = machine        |
| Conservative                                   | Enlightenment, progressive |
| Essential differences of status                | Can be revolutionary       |
| Change has to be partial ( you can cut dead branches but not the whole tree )                      |  Total change is an option ( you can repair the machine but sometimes change is necessary )  |
| Path dependency  and importance of history                                            |   Structured by abstract principes                         |

- BURKE is today the father of modern conservatism ( born in 1844 with the Tamworth Manifesto ) but he was a Whig in late 18<sup>th</sup> ! So **ideological proximity between Whigs and Tories during the 1820s**. 

They were only two clear dividing issues : 
- **Catholic emancipation** 
- **Parliamentary reform** 

⚠ **Parties were based on personal network and not ideology**. So yes, mainly just rhetoric debates… Whigs also like franchise reform because many of the big industrialists are Dissenters/Nonconformists. They couldn’t make a career in politics or administration of gifted ⇒ created companies. 
***
- backwardness ?
- It is striking that …
- ⚠ representativeness and not <strike>representativity</strike> & idem with competitiveness 
- misnomer = nom mal choisi 
- to put something in jeopardy = mettre quelque chose en danger
- The lesser evil = le moindre mal 
- to channel stg = canaliser qqch
