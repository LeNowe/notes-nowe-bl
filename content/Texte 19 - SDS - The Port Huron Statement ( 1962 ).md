## Texte 19 - Students for a Democratic Society - *The Port Huron Statement* ( 1962 )
***
## Introduction 

### 1. Origines of the SDS

#### A ) The Civil Rigths movement

cf. [[Texte 20 - MLK's I have a dream ( 1963 )]]

#### B ) The Free Speech movement ( 1960-1965 )

Rise of new claims for which students mobilize themselves – freedom of speech on campuses, abolition of the death penalty, abolition of compulsory military training at university (made optional in 1963).

At the **University of Berkeley**

The movement started out in 1960 because **Clark Kerr**, the President of the University, told students that **the issues that were directly related to life on campus** (political, economic and religious issues) **could not be debated within the university without prior agreement**. Students demanded the free speech on campus where anyone could express their views on any kind of issue.

This led to immediate protests.

Autumn 1964: creation of the Free Speech movement following a sit-in that gathered 500 students. Hundreds of students arrested and brutalized by police. Teaching assistants organized a strike that paralyzed the university for 5 days. Professors eventually voted a motion supporting students’ claim.

January 1965: **liberalization** of speech on campus.

#### C ) The campaign against nuclear tests

Student Peace Union
- Pacifist movement present on campuses 1960-1963 
- Published a newsletter 
- Organised marches and demonstrations with other organizations
- Disappears after the US, the USSR and the UK signed a treaty banning non underground nuclear tests.

### 2. The creation of the SDS

Main leaders: **AL HABER** and **TOM HAYDEN**.

One of the first organizations **to denounce the Vietnam War** in October 1963. Signed a text with the Student Peace Union.

Were first more focused on **organizing deprived areas with a project called ERAP** (Economic Research and Action Project) in various cities around the country.

Didn’t try to supersede existing groups but to collaborate with already implanted ones.

Tired to provide student activists with theoretical support for a critical analysis of the American society.

Opposition between **theoreticians** (who thought that getting involved into action only without theoretical reflection was dangerous and would hinder the scope of contestation; AL HABER) and **activists** (who were quite suspicious about ideologies, anti-intellectual trend; TOM HAYDEN claimed that students should quit university campuses to go to the ghettos in order to create a bottom up organization). This led to **two factions: the campus organizing faction (minority) and the community organizing faction (majority)**.

Among activists, feeling of **guilt** (of belonging to the middle class while poverty increasingly appears to be a mass phenomenon, cf. MICHAEL HARRINGTON, _The Other America_ 1962).

Emergence in 1963 of **fund-raising orgies**, where participants are supposed to donate sums proportionate the economic status of their parents, as a sort of redeeming action for the privilege of belonging to a well-to-do family and going to college. These orgies went together with a **public confession ritual** – confess that you are a bourgeois, donate money and you’ll be saved.

Desire to put in accordance principles and actions. **Moral radicalism** (revolution starts with oneself, you need to show the way). ‘Existentialist’ attitude.

In 1969, the organization **split into different factions**:  
- The Revolutionary Youth Movement (Maoist) 
- The Weather Underground Organization, or Weathermen (Black Power, anti-Vietnam war, immediate armed struggle)
- The Worker Student Alliance (led by the Progressive Labor Party) (Marxist)

### 3. Main ideas of the SDS

#### A ) Liberal idealism

Defending **fundamental liberties** – freedom of opinion, freedom of choice, freedom of speech. Refer to the main principles inherited from the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution.

#### B ) A-communism

**Refused to exclude communists** even though they thought that the USSR and the communist system were to be fought and criticized. In the name of tolerance.

#### C ) Social criticism

- **Alienation**. 

The notion aims to explain the passive, apathic attitude of students of the time. They have no say in the organization and the content of their education. And after graduating, they will have no say in their working conditions, which will be imposed upon them.

Just like workers are alienated from the product of their labour, **students are alienated from the fruits of their education**.

So students need to refuse to be dispossessed of the power to control the concrete conditions of their education and their work.

- **Manipulation**

Alienation results from **manipulation by the powers that be**, which encourage and support their passivity and non participation in collective issues.

- **False consciousness and deadlocked society**

Unanaware of how manipulated they are, **people tend to turn towards purely material satisfactions**, which enable them to stand the alienation they are the victims of. Deprived of the right to exert control over their lives, they turn to **material well-being**.

In deprived areas, the poor and unemployed **blame other categories for stealing their jobs** (Blacks, women, youth), or blame themselves for it. **They blame socialism, government intervention and defend free enterprise**.

They are capable of developing a political consciousness but they are manipulated by the media and they eventually **integrate the values of the dominant groups**.

- **Criticism of the affluent society**

The affluent society reduces happiness to its material dimension (consumer goods) and relies on **false needs, waste, programmed obsolescence**. It creates **standardized individuals**, deprived of creative capabilities and critical mind. The affluent society is an illusion that hides misery, racism, corruption, hypocrisy.

- **Bureaucracy**

Society is controlled by an **omnipresent bureaucratic system**, whose goal is to preserve the status quo and perpetuate itself. The individual is stuck in a network of complex impersonal rules and procedures. Especially at university.

- **The ruling minority/elite/the Establishment**

**A Power Elite exerts a real authority behind the anonymity of a bureaucracy.** The Establishment = the President, his advisers, Secretaries, top corporation executives, leaders of foundations and political parties. Presented as a socially homogeneous group aiming to preserve the established order.

Denunciation of the Kennedy administration’s relations with big business.

JACK WEINBERG talked about **the military industrial complex** = alliance between top Pentagon executives and defense corporation leaders that agree to impose on society the options they have defined and that serve their interests.

- **Militarization of society**

**The military exert more and more pressure on society and political power**. The military commandment is part of the Power Elite. The Cold War led to the militarization of the business world and of politics, so that the living conditions of citizens increasingly depend on the defense budget.

- **University as a microcosm**

University is accused of **producing individuals with specific skills for the benefit of the economic machine**, individual with no critical minds.

But university also replicates the main defects of society as a whole – alienation, manipulation, bureaucracy, militarization.

Student activism not only aims at reforming university but also society as a whole. University cannot be reformed without a global social revolution.

#### D ) Project

- **Unity and autonomy of the individual**

The individual must no longer be divided into his or her different social roles independent from one another and often with contradictory demands (**worker, citizen, parent**). **Unity of the person**, awareness for the unity of the self. Criticism of Clark Kerr’s _Industrialism and the Industrial Man_ (1962).

Only a global, united individual can feel **solidarity and fraternity** for his fellows. Not a selfish individualism, but a **generous individual** who is genuinely part of society.

- **Participative democracy**

In order to fulfil himself as a person and to find the sense of community, the individual needs **to participate in all the levels of social life**. Participative democracy is the solution to all the evils that plague society (alienation, manipulation, bureaucratization, militarization). Direct participation in the definition and implementation of the rules of collective life. **Faith in the inborn wisdom of the common man** and in the belief that all humans are capable to become autonomous persons. **Participative democracy is the opposite of hierarchized, elitist bureaucracy.** Politics must not be reserved for an elite, a minority of specialists.

**Utopia of an egalitarian, libertarian society, self-managed by common men, including the poor and the homeless.**

- **University as an emancipative institution**

University education must **encourage creativity and the critical mind**. Theme of **general knowledge** (meant to train united, autonomous individuals with moral, esthetic and logical capacities) **as opposed to vocational, technical and specialized knowledge and skills** (supposed to produce the future links in the production chain).

Students r**efuse to consider the world around them as a technical world devoid of conflicting values.** They blame their professors for keeping silence over social conflicts under the guise of objectivity. They think that idealism and subjectivity should be expressed at university, otherwise selfishness and indifference will be encouraged. Passion is compatible with intellectual reflection. The underlying values in social sciences need to be made explicit. But still belief in reason and rational reasoning.

In order to ensure this, university must be kept away from the economic pressure of the outside world and must be managed by the students and professors themselves.

### 4. The strategy of the SDS 
  
#### A ) Free Speech movement

**Immediate, moderate claims**: civil rights, free speech on campus, neutrality towards Cuban regime, ROTC (Reserve Officers’ Training Corps) made optional. Also: **project of the Free University of California** (a counter-university meant to deal with the issues that were not explored or debated in exisiting universities), which would be a model that could then be copied and spread.

#### B ) SDS

**SDS**. At first, **reformist claims**: development and extension of the welfare state; extension of government intervention in the economy (nationalization of ressources and of companies of public interest); development of pacific coexistence, support for international organisations like the UN, aid to third world countries.

But increasingly the SDS **refused to propose specific reforms**, considering the interdependence of fights and claims. Suspicion for partial measures.

**Faith in a bottom-up approach** developed by the ERAP: enabling the poor and the homeless themselves to propose the reforms that they deem necessary.

**Fear of being betrayed by political parties** that might embrace their proposals to reduce them to purely technical or symbolic advances.

#### C ) Direct action

**Getting personally involved** to see your ideas triumph, assuming the risks (including physical risks). Direct action satisfies the fundamental individualism of the new radicals. The individual must personally feel the concrete dimension of the situation that he protests against and of the movement he is part of. Physically feeling the links with the community.

Guiding principle: **the means used need to be in accordance with the goals pursued**. In terms of organization, this means: **decentralization** (autonomy of local groups), **local and collective leadership**, **consensus-based decisions**. The organization of the SDS is meant to be a flexible structure for coordination, a meeting place to exchange ideas and experiences.

Mottos: **grass-roots organization** + **let the people decide**.

**Suspicion for the political order**. But desire to gather all the country’s progressive forces in the Democratic Party, which would thus differentiate itself clearly from the Republican Party, which would gather all conservative forces = **political realignment** as a way to get out of the paralysis of the current political system (the system was blocked because the two main parties are too close to each other). A real two-party, partisan system needs to be set up to give voters a clear choice. But political realignment was a minority opinion in the SDS.

#### D ) **Historical agency of change (Charles Wright Mills)**

**Prominent role given** by the Port Huron Declaration **to students, professors and researchers** (the social group that is the most attached to progress and the most capable of fighting against alienation and bureaucracy).

But the university system cannot act alone. The student left needs **allies: workers, civil rights activists, all liberal forces outside university.**

But the alliance with liberals became less necessary as students movement away from university to indulge in **the “ghetto cult”**. So **the ERAP volunteers saw the poor as the main agents of change,** turning the students into mere catalysts of change that were meant to foster the social and political consciousness of the poor.

### 5. The New Left

#### A ) Political positioning

Opposed to **the Old Left** focused on **labour relations** and **social issues** like wages, working conditions. Rejected its **authoritarianism**. Instead, it focused on **society issues**, influenced by counterculture (civil rights, feminism, homosexual claims, the environmental movement). 

Radical groups were **divided over the attitude to adopt towards liberals**:
  - Some like the SDS are rather **soft towards liberals** as they seek to make an alliance with them
  - Others rail against the false liberalism of the Kennedy administration and designate **liberals as the worst enemies of radicals**. Liberal corporate capitalism is designated as the main cause of the Cold War and of the authoritarian trends in South America. So if the left really wants to reform society, it must break away with liberalism.
  - But they also **tend to reject Soviet socialism** because of its bureaucracy, its authoritarian planification and its focus on production growth. They were often skeptical towards nationalization of production and towards Marxist concepts like the class struggle.

At first, many young activists admired Fidel Castro because they saw in him a man capable of creating a new kind of socialism deprived of bureaucracy and dogmatism, but when Castro and his supporters embraced Marxism-Leninism, they were disappointed.

#### B ) **Charles Wright Mills**

_The Sociological Imagination_ (1959)

Definition of democracy: “In essence, democracy implies that those vitally affected by any decision men make have an effective voice in that decision”.

**Social scientists are criticized for perpetuating the existing social order**, under the guise of objectivity and scientificity. **He denounces their pseudo-objectivity that actually conceals their absence of critical mind and supports the interests of corporations, the military and the government.**

He claims that social scientists are necessarily influenced by values that shape their research and influence their conclusions. Those who claim to be objective merely accept the dominant values.

To him the role of the sociologist is to help common people to become aware of the political and social (collective) dimension of their personal problems.

_Letter to the New Left_ (1960)

**The working class is no longer the main historical agency of change. They should be replaced with students and intellectuals.**

According to CHARLES WRIGHT MILLS, the New Left was characterized by **a focus on issues of culture and identity**, as well as **a rejection of the authoritarian tendencies of the old left**. He saw the New Left as a **more democratic and participatory** form of politics that emphasized individual freedom and social justice.

Mills argued that the New Left was defined by **a new set of concerns, including civil rights, the anti-war movement, feminism, and environmentalism**. These issues reflected a broader shift **away from traditional class-based politics** and towards a more diverse and intersectional understanding of social and political struggles.

Mills also saw the New Left as a response to the **failures of the old left to effectively address the issues of race, gender, and other forms of social inequality**. He believed that the New Left represented a new kind of politics that was more in tune with the concerns and aspirations of the **younger generation**.

Mills thought that the **driving force of social change** was **intellectuals and students** rather than the working class.

#### C ) Paul Goodman

_Growing Up Absurd_ (1960)

The book explores the problems and frustrations faced by American youth in the post-World War II era. Goodman argues that young people are growing up in a society that is absurd and lacking in meaningful opportunities for personal and social fulfillment.

He presents the American society of the 1960s as **an aggregation of conformist individuals** **without any sense of community**. In order to restore it, the government needs to be decentralized to allow citizens to practice direct democracy at the municipal scale.

He **criticizes the education system for its emphasis on conformity and rigid disciplinary structures that stifle the critical mind and creativity**. In _The Community of Scholars_ (1954), he suggested going back to the medieval university model based on small, self-governed communities. He praised collaboration between students and professors.

He thinks **the class struggle is irredeemably a failure** since industry workers have abandoned their ideal of self-governance and interest in the usefulness of their work. In addition, decent wages and Social Security have broken the solidarity that used to bind workers together.

The conclusion is that **marginal groups, the poor, the downtrodden cannot be the historical agencies of change and cannot rebuild society. Only students and professors can rebuild the economy in a more humane way.**

To him, the evils the American society suffers from are neither due to the technological or ecological conditions, nor to the Constitution itself, but rather to the betrayal of “the old radical-liberal program”.

#### D ) Herbert Marcuse

_The One-Dimensional Man_ (1964) = an **indictment of consumerism** and the consumer society as a totalitarian system concealed under the appearance of an affluent society. 

The one-dimensional society is characterized by **a "happy consciousness" that accepts and even celebrates consumerism** as it fulfills false needs created by the system itself. This consciousness is created and maintained through **the manipulation of language and images by the media and other cultural institutions**. Marcuse argues that this manipulation serves to reinforce the dominant ideology and prevent dissent or opposition. 

**Solution: negative thinking**. For Herbert Marcuse, negative thinking refers to a critical perspective that seeks **to uncover and challenge the dominant ideology and power structures of society**. It involves questioning the status quo and the assumptions and values that underpin it. Negative thinking is a form of dissent that rejects the existing reality and imagines alternative possibilities. Marcuse argues that negative thinking is necessary in order to resist the one-dimensional society, which offers few alternatives or possibilities for change. Negative thinking involves a refusal to accept the happy consciousness that is promoted by the media and other cultural institutions, and instead, seeks **to reveal the contradictions and limitations of the dominant ideology**. 

According to Herbert Marcuse, the driving force of the revolution is **the "Great Refusal,"** which is a rejection of the existing reality and the dominant ideology of society. The Great Refusal is a form of negative thinking.

Marcuse argues that the Great Refusal arises from a deep-seated dissatisfaction with the status quo and a desire for radical change. It is driven by **a rejection of the false needs and desires that are created by the system**, and a recognition of the possibility for alternative forms of life and society.

Herbert Marcuse believed that the revolutionary struggle for a more just and free society would be led by **a coalition of various groups, including the working class, intellectuals, students, and marginalized communities.**

Marcuse believed that **the working class would play a central role in the revolution**, as they had the potential to disrupt the system through their collective labor power. However, Marcuse also recognized **the limitations of the traditional Marxist emphasis on the working class as the sole revolutionary force**, and he argued that other groups would also be necessary to create a truly radical and transformative movement.

In particular, Marcuse saw **the role of intellectuals and students** as crucial in developing a critical consciousness and a new radical imagination. He believed that these groups had the potential to create new ideas and alternative forms of social and political organization that could challenge the existing power structures and dominant ideology.
