# The question of housing in the US
***
Are home prices decreasing ? **In 2023, no spectacular drop, prices are stabilising**. But **growing trend from 1990s to our days** ⇒ **harder to buy a home**. 14% of renters are behind on rent and 7% behind on mortgage ⇒ lot of household are stressed by the questions of housing. High prices especially in metropolitan areas. 

**Why high prices ? More demand** (demographic growth, changes in families’ structure, jobs are concentrated in metropolitan areas = where the jobs are) and **supply is not increasing commensurately** (no buildings in LA because created after WWII so cars allowed to work more far away). **You can’t turn LA-like cities in NY-like cities because of zoning codes** = local laws defining the kind of housing that can be built (= single-family houses ⇒ blocks of flats are illegal) ⇒ **nimbyism** (= Not In My Backyard, buildings will decrease the value of my little bungalow ouin ouin). 

**High prices are rising but the home-ownership rate does not fall** (importance of property). 

Recently, **Arizona had limited construction around Phoenix as its water supply dwindles** (water is a finite ressource there !). 

Some places (California, the Golfe of Mexico) are exposed to natural disaster on a regular basis. But **now, natural disasters are bigger and they are more of them** ⇒ the insurance company will **increase your premium** (up and up and up ! until people are unable to pay ⇒ if the house is destroyed, it is not built back ⇒ people will leave these places). <u>Ex</u> : the largest insurer in California decided not to insure anymore new houses ! But in fact, **people are going more and more in the places where people should not go** <u>Ex</u> : the Sunbelt. The insurance effect has not happened yet ! Politicians have stepped in to provide insurance anyway ! 

- **1992** : **Hurricane Andrew** devastated Florida ⇒ cost $16bn 
- **2012** : Florida was liable for damage up to $ ½ tn (7× state budget) 
- So the Federal State stepped in ⇒ is starting to say « you’ve got to leave ! » 
- Start of an **acknowledgement = natural disasters are uninsurable** (insuring works on a small scale)
