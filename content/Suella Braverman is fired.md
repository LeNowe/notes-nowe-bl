# November : Suella Braverman is fired
***
- Fired from SUNAK’s government 
- **Who** : Former Home Secretary of State, controversial political figure ( on immigration )
- **What** : She criticised the police in November for being lax with a pro-Palestinian « hate march » ( in reality, peaceful demonstration… ) ⇒ undermined the police’s independence + bad image for the CS before the general election 
- **Next** : D.CAMERON appointed as Foreign Secretary 

## Liz Truss’s fall

This **reshuffle is the last of a long list** ! <u>Ex</u> : « This lettuce outlasted Liz Truss » = 50 days = shortest in UK’s history. 

**⇒ Liz TRUSS’s fall**
- Kwasi KWARTENG = « **Kami-Kwasi** » and his mini-budgets ⇒ significative tax cuts targeting the richest ! 
- Meanwhile, **difficulties to make ends meets** : ↗ food banks + ↗ mortgage’s interest with inflation 
- **Financial panic** : markets thought that UK might default 
- Everybody predicted it but still she did it 

## Suella Braverman 

**⇒ She is among other an example that ethnic minorities can sometimes succeed in politics**
- SUNAK 
- Sadiq KHAN 
- James CLEVERLY 

insert her bio ( Bonneville )
- **A true believer in Brexit** ( European Research Group )

**⇒ BRAVERMAN’s good ideas**
- **Rough sleeping = « lifestyle choice »**
- Her « dream » = see asylum seekers on a fight for Rwanda 
- **Rwanda Plan** to dissuade economic migrant = send some asylum seekers ⇒ could apply for asylum there ( for Rwanda or another country ) ⇒ claiming that asylum seekers = economic migrant. But **UK’s SC ruled that it was illegal & violating the ECHR** ( ⚠ nothing to do with the EU ) but post-WWII convention. 
- Some elements of **populism** ( extreme simplicity, limited respect of institutions, extreme argument ) but not presenting herself as the people’s saviour. 

**⇒ Why she resigned or was fired ?** 
- Yes perhaps Palestine BUT she made public her vitriolic letter of resignation addressed to SUNAK mentioning a written contract between the two and claiming to be heir of Brexit vote from 2016 to CP’s landslide in 2019 
- **2019** : BOJO platform = yes Brexit BUT also « levelling up » *i.e* reducing economic disparities between different parts of UK by public spending. 
- **During the Brexit Campaign demagogy was normalised** ! 

**Famous « Breaking Point » poster** : 
- **Nigel FARAGE** = historic leader of **UKIP** ( = United Kingdom Independence Party )
- Pre-2016 : UK within UE ⇒ free circulation 
- But on the poster = Syrian and Afghans refugees ⇒ poster = **complete lie** 
- Paradox : Britain with Brexit does not have more power to stop the non-European migration 

UK wanted to leave the UE to **negotiate better trade agreements** but it was **untrue again** ! Because UK alone is weaker alone. OBAMA said that Brexit would put UK « back of the queue ». 

**Dangerous footnote** : **the Brexit Campaign lied to a huge extent and they won**. Theresa MAY (2016-19) was charged to deliver Brexit ! She decided to find reconciliation with reality by offering a « **soft Brexit** ». But she failed and her party got rid of her. She was replaced by BOJO, a pathological lier ! He failed too. Replaced by LIZ TRUSS. 

In **2016** the Conservative politicians split between pro-Brexit and pro-Remain. But after the referendum the Conservative party started to identify to Brexit ⇒ **pro-remain conservative were marginalised** ⇒ **reduced the pool of conservative talent and empowered the politicians with a laxer relationship with reality**. 

Huge tension between the **temptation to continue impossible policies and governing by acknowledging reality**. 

**How the Conservative party selects its leaders ?** 
- 1st stage that works well : the Parliamentary Party selects 2 candidates 
- 2nd stage that doesn’t : Conservative members 
- But ↘ of the Cons Party members ≈ 180k = 0,4% of the electorate 
- They’re old white men living in London and South East 

## Post-scriptum 

**Safety of Rwanda ( Asylum and Immigration ) Bill**. Risk of explosion in the CP. Parliament says « oh yes it is safe and judges can’t look at any evidences ». **Legal contradiction** with the European Convention on Human Rights ( but Britain is not willing to quit ECHR ! ). But unlikely to be enforced. Because it needs judicial debates = too long to enact the law before the elections. 

**Cruel and ineffective immigration policies** are typical in Britain <u>Ex</u> : « wave machines » in 2020. 

> The aim is to create, here in Britain, a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants. – Home Secretary Theresa May, 2012 

**1948** : **The Empire Windrush** = ship bringing 500 Jamaican immigrants to Britain. Start of non-white immigration. The government did not do the paper work and did not write down their names. So big scandal when some were chased into « self-deportation » in 2010s. 

- **1970s** : net emigration ( Australia, NZ )
- **1980-today** : net immigration 
- **2010** : CAMERON’s promise to limit to « ten of thousands » 
- **2023** : +745k people in Britain 

Asylum seekers ( = boats in the Channel ) are a small fractions of the immigrants. The main reason is to **study**, then to **work**. Humanitarian reasons and to seek asylum are behind ! And Britain needs these people ! Foreign students pays a lot so that British students pay less ! 

**Because you cannot ↘ the whole phenomenon ( because your economy needs it ! ) you decide to be cruel with a minority and to enforce noneffective law.** 

**But the population sure is sceptical but there is no phenomenal hostility** ! And opposition to immigration is going down.  

**Hostility among old people and fewer in the young population ⇒ Conservative anti-immigration stance**. The CP is ↗ detached from reality ≈ the Rep party ⇒ ↘ party of government’s status.
