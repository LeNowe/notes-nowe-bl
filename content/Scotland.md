**2014** : failed referendum 
Nicola STURGEON = minister of the SNP, woman 
Holyrood 
Humza YOUSAF = current leader of the SNP 
Devolution 

**Independence is not imminent (more and more unlikely) but big issue of democratic representation**. 

The **SNP** was super dominant historically. But **now turning point = decline of the SNP**. 

**Devolution (1998)** 
- In theory : sovereignty remains in the hands of Westminster but some powers are devolved 
- Reality : operates like a federal system ⇒ UK couldn’t take powers back 
- Westminster : defence, diplomacy, immigration, most taxation 
- Holyrood : NHS, Scotland Education ⇒ ∅ tuition fees 

**The limits of Butskellism and the reality of its existence : the example of the steel industry**
- Nationalised under ATLEE but surprising because it was profitable 
- Only industry that the Conservatives privatised during the Post-war Consensus 
- **1967** : Renationalisation = « defensive » nationalisation (would collapse otherwise) ⇒ kept by the Conservatives until the THATCHER’s years = considered that the inevitable death of these old industries = good thing (would free capital and workers) ⇒ Scots against the Conservatives 

**2023** : STURGEON resigned (accused of embezzlement) ⇒ SNP associated with corruption 

**Motivation of the Scottish nationalists ?**
- Appeared during the interwar period (influenced by Irish nationalism)
	- Scottish National Party 
	- Wales : Plaid Cymru (pronounced Cumry)
- Until 1970s : electorally irrelevant
- But big gap between Scottish Nationalists and Welsh nationalists 

**1603** : **Union of the Crows** (James VI of Scotland = James I of England) but England and Scotland remained independent. 

**1707** : **Scotland and England merged**

**1970s** : North Sea Oil. If Scotland became independent, the oil would become scottish but less public money (Barnett formula).

**No clear lead for any of two sides** ⇒ **result = the status quo** 

But the SNP asked to do the referendum after the Brexit ! (because it becomes a different questions). Why ? The Scottish population voted to remain in the EU ⇒ reactivated the idea that Scotland has a different political project than the UK. 

**More numerous and deeper links between Scotland/UK than between UK/EU ⇒ extreme intricacy of the process of independence** 
- Common national debt 
- Common currency 
- Defence (UK’s nuclear bombs are in Scotland) 
- Access to UK market 

**Some members of the EU might refuse Scotland’s entrance** (because they have their own separatist movement)
- Belgium (Flemish)
- Spain (Basque)

**In term of the costs/benefits analysis, independence does not seem extremely attractive**…So, what’s the point of the SNP ? 

Is Labour is going to attract former SNP’s voters ? If it is the Conservative ⇒ they will be in power for a long time. 

## The West Lothian question 

**⇒ Constitutional asymetry**
- Holyrood → purely Scottish affairs (<u>Ex</u> : no tuition fees for Scotland) = Scottish voters decide for Scotland 
- Westminster → British affairs (<u>Ex</u> : defence) + purely English affairs = British (Scotland + Wales + England) voters decide for England 

But it is unlikely to foster a popular movement… 

***
- deindustrialisation 
- bread-and-butter questions = questions de pouvoir d’achat (vs questions politiques)
- permanent state of affairs = tendance actuelle 
- to wield influence 
- a Trojan horse 
- to impose stg <u>on</u> sb 
- to spy <u>on</u> sb 
- competitiveness = compétitivité
