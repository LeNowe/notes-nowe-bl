Two KKK 
- Wave of the Civil War 
- **1915** : 

**The first Klan**
- Founded in Tennessee by 6 Confederate veterans as a sort of fraternity. Main purpose = make sure that after the abolition of slavery former slaves would be kept in a state of submission. Using threats and extreme violence ( including murders ). 
- Many other groups all around the the South 
- Defending white supremacy on racial and political levels 
- Attacked black people who wanted to exert their right to vote 
- Attacked black but also white republican
- ≈ thousands of murders 
- **1870-1871**  : The Fed government retaliated with Enforcement Acts 
- The Klan declined and disappeared. 

**A revival**
- Following D.W GRIFFITH, *The birth of a nation* = racist movie 
- Founded in Georgia by William Jay SIMMONS but ? superseded him and became the leader 
- Mass and structured organisation ≈ several million members 
- Organised marches in the open street  
- Still white supremacy but not only ! 
	- Protestant majority ⇒ attacked against Catholics, Jews, immigrants 
	- Conservative claims towards gambling, « sexual immorality » 
- Rose in few months and faded away almost as quickly 
- **Late 1920s** : started to decline 

## Analysis 

- Catholics can’t be good Americans because they pledge allegiance to a alien power 
- Catholics presented as spies ⇒ justifies the organisation 
- Only they own the true definition of Americanism ! 
- Religious and political aspects are intertwined 
- Appearance of rationality 
- Social Darwinism in a racial sense
