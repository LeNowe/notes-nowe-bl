# Texte 4 : Jackson’s Case for the Removal Act ( 1831 )
***
Andrew JACKSON = populist Democrat elected in 1824 

**Election of 1824** = 3 candidates ∈ Democrats ⇒ beginning of the **2nd party system** 
- ADAMS & CLAY → elite ⇒ 2nd and 3rd 
- JACKSON → common people ⇒ 1st ! but not an absolute majority of Great electors 
- The House of Representatives had to choose and chose ADAMS. He made CLAY his Secretary of State. JACKSON denounced a « **corrupt bargain** » between ADAMS & CLAY = backstage deal to keep the people out of power. 
- JACKSON immediately begun to campaign and was elected in **1828**. 

There was a **property qualification to vote** at that time. Gradually more and more states renounced to it and accepted universal white male suffrage. By **1828** it has disappeared everywhere ⇒ better chance for JACKSON ! Just after his election he invited any one to the White House. 

He introduced the **spoils system** to make sure that all the administration has the same aims than the president. 

JACKSON was more willing than other politicians to dismiss the rights of Native Americans. 

American politics between 1800 and 1861 : 
- **Slavery** = South V.S North 
- **Westward movement** = everyone in favour because perceived as necessary to the survivance of democracy ( ↗ growing population needed land to be self-sufficient ) ⇒ eviction of Indians. That is why the US = « an **imperial republic** ». 

JACKSON tries in this text to justify seizing Indian land by arguing that this will benefits Indian too. Why should he bother ? Attempt to **make sure that the dispossession of Indians appears as entirely legal** making impossible legal challenges in the future. 

## <u>I. A mutually profitable policy</u> 

### A ) Difficult cohabitation 

- Competition for natural ressources ⇒ ↘ Native population 
- But mainly :  colonisation ⇒ new germs ! ⇒ large scale epidemics ⇒ ↘↘ Native population  
- Also superior technology ⇒ able to **impose « treaties »** 

### B ) Institutional tensions

- Tensions between states and Federal government
- The Constitution considers that **Indian tribes ≈ foreign nations** ⇒ Indian policy was a f**ederal prerogative**. Indian were residents ≠ citizens. 
- But the states were very tempted to interfere in favour of white populations. 
- **1828** : Georgia extended its jurisdiction to Indian population ⇒ denial of Indian’s sovereignty = **legal conquest** before taking the land ! So Georgia is far beyond its power. 
- Why JACKSON was so concerned to avoid confrontation with the states ? Because he was managing the nullification crisis ! 
### C ) Voluntary removal 

- Relocating Indian tribes beyond the Mississipi river = territories that became American with the Louisiana Purchase = land under the jurisdiction of the Federal state. 
- **1830** : IRA = beginning of the **policy of reservations**  
- JACKSON presented the removal policy as a **permanent solution** because it seems to be so far to be reached by demographic expansion. 
- The swapping of territories is presented as a « **fair exchange** ». 

## <u>II. The ideological vindication of removal</u> 

### A ) A universalist and progressive vision

- A more rational use of ressources 
- Rephrasing the theory of ***terra nullius*** derived from LOCKE’s philosophy = incorporating work into a piece of land justifies the ownership of the land = used by settlers to justify colonisation because Indian had not transform the land, according to us. <u>Ex</u> : l.35-40 « **few thousand savages** » V.S « **extensive Republic** » and flourishing progress. 
- Anticipating the ideology of « **Manifest Destiny** » ( ⚠ created in 1845 by John O’SULLIVAN ) = describing an inevitable shift = succession of generations ( ⇒ supposing a common essence so not racist ). 

### B ) Integrating Indians into the US narrative 

- cf. l. 45 
- moving West = a way of pursuing happiness in an uninhabited land to acquire property = just like our ancestors is saying JACKSON ! 

## <u>III. Indian doom</u> 

### A ) No country for Indians 

- **Don’t care of the survival of Indians** ⇒ not troubled by their possible disappearance 
- Hopefully **they will gradually become European**
- They can continue to exist as separate individuals but not as a culture 

**The « 5 civilised tribes »** = adopted western habits ( agriculture, constitution, proto-bureaucracy, translated Bible ). 
- Concerned by the removal 
	- <u>Choctaws</u>
	- <u>Chickasaws</u>
- Cherokees
- Creeks 
- Seminoles 

### B ) Spoliation 

- **Financial advantages for the Federal Government** ⇒ the land quit by Indians would be given to the federal government allowing it to sell it to states and make $ 
- In reality, **Indians had not the choice** ! JACKSON told the Indians : « it is our deal or local states were going to encroach on Indian sovereignty and we, the federal government will not be able to stop it » ( = absolutely false ). 

## Compléments 

**1831** : Cherokee Nation v. Georgia 
- SC said : sorry we have **no juridiction** because Cherokee = « **domestic dependent nation** »
- But the end of the ruling said : bring us the case from an individual and we will be able to judge 

**1832** : WORCESTER V. Georgia ⇒ **Cherokee Nation = sovereign nation** ! ⇒ JACKSON : « MARSHALL [the chief justice of the SC] has made his decision. Now let him enforce it. » = I’m going to ignore that ruling = omg ⚠ Sur les sujets type institutionnel toujours commenter la question des rapports de force réel. 

**1879** : Creation of the PRATT School in Pennsylvania = « **kill the Indian & save the man** »

**1887** : DAWES Severalty Act to privatise Indian land. Put an **end to the concept of tribal ownership of the land**. The land was divided in plots owned by individual native american ⇒ making easier to pressure Indian into selling… ⇒ ↗ sales to western settlers 

**1924** : SNYDER Act = citizenship was given to Indians 

**1934** : Indian Reorganisation Act which repealed the DAWES Act.
