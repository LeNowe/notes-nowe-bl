# Orwell, *The Lion and the Unicorn*
***
## Introduction 

On May 1940, the recently-appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared : 

>  I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.

This famous sentence demonstrates clearly that Churchill realized that to win the war, the forces of modernity must be mobilized and the whole nation given a single purpose. Indeed the triggering of world war two has definitely made entered the world in the mass era. In other words, the construction of national identities that occurred throughout the nineteenth century in western countries and that have been seriously catalysed by their traumatic confrontation during the first world war culminates in the rise of fascism in Italy and broadly speaking in the advent of totalitarian regimes in Germany and in the URSS in the early hours of World War II. With the Fall of France in May-June 1940 Britain’s become the only ally fighting against the Axis. During the Battle of Britain, form August to October 1940 British pilots heroically resisted against the numerous planes of the Luftwaffe. In front of his failure to force Britain’s army to capitulate Hitler changed the Luftwaffe strategy and began until May 1941 a form of terror tactics called the Blitz by massively bombing civilian targets to annihilate the people’s resistance. But he faced a second time Britain’s resistance. Indeed, the majority of Britain’s population were seeing the war as the harsh means of a better future. 
It is the case of the socialist writer George Orwell. Despite his poor health he engaged himself in the Home-guard, a patriotic armed militia, to prevent a potential German invasion. Indeed, after the German-Soviet pact’s reveal in 1939, Orwell denounces communist purported pacifism and acknowledges the potential strength of patriotism to resist to fascism. Well-know for his commitment in the Spanish civil war among Spanish communist militias Orwell exposed in his novels like *1984* or the *Animal farm* his complete opposition to totalitarianism. At the heart of the Blitz he wrote a political pamphlet entitled *The Lion and the Unicorn : Socialism and the English Genius* where he tries to demonstrate how being a socialist and being a patriot are no longer antithetical but complementary. In the first part called « England Your England » the author tries to depict and reignite what he calls the « English civilisation ».
In this respect, it behoves us to ask : how the wartime context pushes George Orwell to articulates a jingoistic conception of national identity and his enlighten conception of socialist patriotism to redefine the « English civilisation » in accordance with the post-war modern world he is calling for. 
First of all, we well see that in the context of the Blitz Orwell tries to galvanize England’s people and expresses the urgent need for « England’s civilisation » to resist against the threat of totalitarianism. Secondly, we well study how he transforms modern patriotism into a positive and socialist-friendly force. And finally we well see that his praise of England’s cultural superiority is based on a non-conservative jingoism opened to change and modernity. 

## <u>I) The urgent need to galvanize England’s people</u> 

In a first point we can notice that this essay written during the height of the Blitz’s bombings, reflects Orwell's desire to galvanize the English people to resist the totalitarian threat. Through his writing, Orwell sought to inspire the English people to come together and fight against these forces of tyranny and destruction. 

### The staging of Britain’s face to face with fascism 

Historical references ( «Hitler, Mussolini» or to « Hitler June Purge » that refers to the Night of the Long Knives )  is omnipresent in this text to make sensitive the time of crisis that Britain is facing. In order to awaken the people of England and call for resistance in context of the Blitz Orwell stages Britain’s face to face with fascism. The first sentence « As I write, highly civilized human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me » stresses immediately the urgency of the situation. By opposing the « kind hearted and law-abiding » individual to the « country » and his power to « absolve him from evil » if he manages to blow the author into pieces Orwell denounces the totalitarian conception of State crushing the individual, his liberty and his private life. Thus, this first sentence reminds one of the most famous excerpt from *1984* describing the future of humanity under the rule of Big Brother as « a boot stamping on a human face—forever ». 

### Call to action the reader 

In front of the threat that represents Nazi Germany destroying and engulfing Britain, Orwell calls to action his reader. Himself was engaged in the Home guard, a civil armed milita organized in case of a German landing. In order to do so, he intends to speak to individuals directly by awaking a wartime patriotism based on individual initiative and responsibility . That is the sense of the title of the first part of Orwell’s essay « England, Your England » or the family metaphor comparing the country to a child trying to reconnect individuals to the defence of the country. He also writes « it is your civilisation, it is you » or « it is yours, you belong to it ». In this respect the text seems close to propaganda and reminds for instance Uncle Sam’s posters used by America in the first wolrd war.  

Thus we see how Orwell is forced to acknowledges the necessity of patriotism to maintain the people’s resistance. Nevertheless, as an ardent defender of individual liberty, he does not promote a blind and totalitarian patriotism based on brainwashing and uniformisation. Hence, to reconnect individuals to the national feeling as a socialist Orwell has to redefine what he calls the « English genius ».

## <u>II) The will to transform patriotism into a positive force</u>

So in a second point we can notice that Orwell felt that patriotism, when harnessed for good, could be a transformative force for progress and justice. In this text appears clearly his will to subvert the nature of patriotism from an instrument of domination to a driving force for positive change. 

### The modern stake of patriotism 

First, Orwell willingly acknowledges the modern stake of patriotism ( l.8-9 ) and the weakness of universalist ideologies like « Christianity » or « International Socialism » in front of it. To pursue and win the war Britain must gather around patriotism hence on his national singularity.

### The will to avoid the dead end of xenophobia 

Nonetheless Orwell tries to avoid the dead end of jingoism and xenophobia. It is noticeable in the first paragraph where Orwell evokes the humanity of the German soldiers that are bombarding England. Orwell is probably managing to elaborate a conception of patriotism compatible with internationalism and socialism. Indeed Orwell mentions Spain where he fought during the Civil War along with Spanish communists.

Hence we now have to ask us how Orwell conciliates the necessity of defending patriotism to resist to the totalitarian threat and socialism ? In other words how to defend the necessity to defend the high dignity of a culture without sinking into jingoism and conservatism ?


## <u>III) The praise of the superiority of England’s culture</u>

In the last point we can now properly appreciate how his praise of the superiority of England’s culture tries to conciliate a rooted national pride and desire of change and progress. 

### An ethno-cultural conception of nation 

Orwell as in this text an ethno-cultural conception of nation that reminds the nineteenth-century and defends natural differences between nations.

« Also, one must admit that the divisions between nation and nation are founded on real differences of outlook  » & « average of human behaviour » that differs enormously from country to country 

He talks about « their mild knobby faces, their bad teeth and gentle manners » But he precises that these manners are distinct from the « European crowd »

Indeed, Orwell adds that « English are very differentiated » from other western people and especially from Germany.

### The lyrical portrait of England’s cultural singularity 

After establishing that it exists real differences between nation Orwell praises in a lyrical and emotional portrait England’s cultural singularity and in doing so argues implicitly that Britain is one of the most civilized people in the world. He undertakes to depict the English « national way of life ».

### An organic conception of nation trying to conciliate the cultural grassroots of its patriotic pride and its opening to change and to the modern world 

But we can notice that Orwell takes over an organic conception of nation trying to conciliate the cultural grassroots of its patriotic pride and its opening to change and to the modern world. The idea that society is like living being goes probably back to the ideas of Herbet Spencer, a English philosopher and sociologist, that studied the developments of modern societies as the growth of organism. This metaphor is useful for Moreover the organic metaphors draws continuity between the past, « the England of 1840 » and the « the England of 1940 » and so gives a changing but coherent image of the nation. 

« It is continuous, it stretches into the future and the past, there is something in it that persists, as a living creature. » 
Compares with a child of five 

« Nothing, except that you happen to be the same person » galvanize a people around a unified identity

This organic link between the individual and the history of its civilisation attaches him to the destiny of its country. 

« You will never be happy away from it for any length of time » ⇒ « Suet puddings and red pillar-boxes » have « entered into your soul. »

Moreover the organic metaphor allows Orwell to elaborate an outward-looking patriotism compatible with socialism. Indeed an organism may grow and evolve positively to achieve its true nature. That’s why he portrays England as a seed whose future is in part undetermined.

Finally the vegetable metaphor, between the turnip seed and the parsnip illustrates Orwell’s redefinition of patriotism between cultural identity and willingness to progress in the modern world. 

« It is therefore of the deepest importance to try and determine what England is, before guessing what part England can play in the huge events that are happening »

## Conclusion 

To conclude, this essay written under the Nazi bombings calls for resistance the entire English people by praising the high dignity of its culture and its way of life. But is also a reflection on the overwhelming patriotism and national loyalty that defines the modern world. If the advent of totalitarian regimes allowed George Orwell to acknowledge the unbeatable strength of patriotism he intends in this text to demonstrate that it’s to possible to subvert the logic of patriotism. Being a socialist and being a patriot are no longer antithetical but rather complementary to fight the forces of tyranny and destruction and work towards for a better post-war world. Thus, this war-time essay illustrates Orwell’s unwavering commitment to the values of freedom and justice. Indeed, the author of *1984* is neither a politician nor a political theorist or an ideologist but rather an ardent defender of justice, combing back from Spain and finding his country  in shreds, reflecting on what a free citizen must do in dark ages. In other words, this text of George Orwell is kind of performative : self-commitment is indeed the very essence of an enlighten and socialist patriotism.
This text became later a national reference in Britain, to such an extent that John Major quoted it in a speech in 1993. Nonetheless, the paradigm of England’s moral superiority that Orwell stresses, of course in a war-time context, could be also seen as an insidious scrap of Britain’s imperialism and as one of the main roadblocks to the emancipation of colonized people in the post-war period.
