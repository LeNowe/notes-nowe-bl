The New nationalism speech

## Context 

**⇒ The Progressive Era** ( **1880-1910** )
- Reaction against social Darwinism = dominant ideology that had driven the economic expansion = « wild capitalism » ⇒ exploitation of workers and accumulation of profits by the « robber barrons »
- Several manifestations 
	- A demand of nationalisation of utilities = « gas and water socialism »
	- Fairer redistribution of wealth in favour of consumers 
	- Dev of new professions = social workers <u>Ex</u> : Toynbee Hall 
	- Existing jobs reinterpreted : journalism towards more investigation <u>Ex</u> : investigations and books by the Muckrakers especially in the meat packing factories of Chicago with Upton SINCLAIR, *The Jungle* 

⇒ **Theodor ROOSEVELT** ( **1838 - 1919** )
- Nickname = « Teddy  »
- Born in N.Y.C in wealthy family = moneyed elite 
- Studied at Harvard 
- Elected at the age of 23 y.o to N.Y local assembly 
- His wife and his mother died the same day 
- **1886** : lost N.Y.C mayor election 
- **1895** : appointed President of the Board of Police commissioners ⇒ fighting against corruption 
- Wage war against spain ( ? ) and managed the gov to launch a war against spain ⇒ status of « National War Hero » ⇒ he ran for the position of Governor of N.Y and was elected.
- Policy that aimed to protect workers & to regulate corporations & preserving natural ressources 
- **1900** : chosen to be on the Republican ticket for Vice-Presidency for McKINLEY relection campaign. It worked ! McKINLEY was shot and ROOSEVELT became president at the age of 32 ! 
- Policy of the **square deal** = fight against big corporations & break up railway conglomerate. But careful also not to offend Conservatives. 
	- Fight against big corporations 
	- Preserving natural ressources 
	- Strong Fed gov interventions 
	- Protect the Consumer 
- **1904** : elected President quite easily ( = popular )
- **1905** : Nobel peace prize for acting as a peace maker in Russia-Japan relationships 
- **1907-08** : ??? fleat 
- **Roosevelt corollary**  = possibility for the US to intervene in South america to enforce its claims 
- Supported the *Food and drug organisation* 
- Biggest mistake of his life by designating Howard THAFT as his successor ! ( = elected in **1908** ). He goes in Safari ! But every thing he had planned collapsed. THAFT acted against his plans. 
- Richard BALLINGER ( = Secretary of Interior appointed by THAFT ) & Gifford PINCHOT ( = chief of department of Forest appointed by ROOSEVELT  ). BALLINGER wanted the protection of forest to be decentralised whereas PINCHOT wanted to continue a Federal policy. 
- **1912** : ROOSEVELT announce his nomination for the Republican candidacy. Failed. So ran on the Progressive ticket. Divisions among Republicans led to the election of Woodrow WILSON.
- When WWI broke out he reintegrated the Republican party and urged WILSON to get into the War.
- **1919** : died at the moment he was the favourite of the Republican nomination 
- **About his personnality** : 
	- Muscular and violent
	- Boxing ring inside the White House 
	- Excellent orator 
	- Liked to be at the center of attention : « He wanted to be bride at every wedding. He wanted to be the corpse at every funeral »

**⇒ Immediate context of 1910**
- ROOSEVELT tries to comeback in this campaign 
- At the time : Republican party = divided because influence of progressive ideas 
- Party under the control of THAFT and the Conservatives 
- Developed the concept of **new nationalism** and made a tour of western states = federal government intervention in economic and social affaires 
- Inspired by Herbert CROLY *The promise of American life* ( **1909** )
	- Hamiltonian means V.S Jeffersonian values 

## Analysis 

- Equality of opportunity = in between free capitalism and socialism 
- Populist stance 
- Meritocracy 
- Strong manly leadership 

Issue at stake : Reenact the Jacksonian stance and definition of a middle way between socialism and wild capitalism.
