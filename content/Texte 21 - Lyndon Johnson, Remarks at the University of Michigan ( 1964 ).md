## Introduction 

### Lyndon Baines Johnson ( 1908 - 1973 )

**Lyndon Baines Johnson (1908-1973)
- Born to an upper middle class family in Texas
- Studied to become a teacher
- Taught for a year before starting a political career as assistant to a Texas Congressman in Washington DC

**1935** : became the head of the state National Youth Administration Office, a New Deal agency

**1937** : **elected US Representative of Texas** by supporting the programs of FDR, who became one of his mentors
- supported electrification of countryside areas in his district
- managed to get funding for a dam in his district

**1941** : ran for the US Senate but was defeated

**1948** : **elected US Senator** (won by 87 votes, suspicion of fraud, nicknamed “Landslide Lyndon”)

**Backed TRUMAN’s and EISENHOWER’s Cold War policies**, making sure that Texas benefited from heavy defense industry. 

**1955** : **became Senate majority leader**

Was criticised by liberal Democrats for being too flexible / moderate with Republican presidents, but prided himself on his ability to bargain with EISENHOWER to secure needed legislation. Supported the 1957 Civil Rights Act (the first since 1875), but manoeuvred to get a watered-down version of the bill with limited effects. His persuasion efforts were called the **“Johnson treatment”**. On the part of EISENHOWER, the purpose was to divide the Democrats (liberal wing in the North, conservative wing in the South). 

**1960** : **defeated in the Democratic primaries by KENNEDY; agreed to become his running mate**

**1963** : **became President after KENNEDY’s assassination**. Displayed sensitivity and statesmanship by stressing the theme of continuity in carrying out KENNEDY’s program. 

**1964** : **Civil Rights Act**
- banned racial discrimination in public accomodation 
- prohibited discrimination by employers and unions
- authorised the Federal government to deny public funding for segregated schools

Implemented a policy of major tax cuts. In a context of high, continuous economic growth and the affluent society, it was believed that it was possible to implement a whole series of social measures while lowering taxes and increasing military spending. 

**1964** : **won the presidential election by a landslide against BARRY GOLDWATER** (an arch-conservative who had managed to win the Republican primaries; this marked the beginning of the assault of conservatives on the Republican party, which they were eventually to take over in the end of the 70s-early 80s). 

His program = the **GREAT SOCIETY**

### Civil rights 

**1965** : **Voting Rights Act**
- expanded federal power over voting, invalidating literacy tests and other practices meant to exclude Blacks
- required southern cities and states to get permission from the federal Justice Department to change their voter registration laws

**1968 : Civil Rights Act**
- banned race discrimination in housing, including renting
- expanded federal laws making interference with a citizen’s civil rights a federal crime 

### War on poverty

**1964 : Food Stamp Act** = made food stamp program permanent

**1964 : Economic Opportunity Act**
- creation of the Jobs Corps + Neighborhood Youth Corps, providing work and income, basic remedial education and job training to impoverished youth

- grants for adult education 
- creation of the Legal Services Program = lawyers provided to defend the rights of low-income citizens
- expansion of the food-stamp program for low-income Americans 

**1965 :  Social Security Act = ⚠ partial coverage**

Several other Social Security Acts increased old-age benefits, disability benefits, extended eligibility and coverage

**1965 : creation of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities** 

**1969 : creation of PBS** (Public Broadcasting Service)

### Vietnam War 
  
Relied on advisers he had inherited from KENNEDY, who were committed to the defense of SOuth Vietnam, a policy upheld successively by TRUMAN, EISENHOWER and KENNEDY. 

Accepted the **domino theory** - the belief that a victory of North Vietnam would lead to the spread of communism in the whole Southeast Asia. 

**1964** : an attack on the American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin. JOHNSON persuaded Congress to grant him unlimited power to use force to defend South Vietnam. 

**Early 1965** : US war planes started to bomb North Vietnam

**July 1965** : sent 50,000 troops to Vietnam but refused to declare war

**By 1968** : 500,000 troops had been sent = failure of the strategy

**Late 1967** : Tet offensive = victory of the US but at a very high cost (destructions and deaths). JOHNSON refused to send an additional 200,000 troops. 

**1968 : decided not to run for reelection**
- The Democratic Party was deeply divided between anti-war and war Democrats. 
- The Democratic nomination was won by HUBERT HUMPHREY (after the assassination of ROBERT KENNEDY), who lost to RICHARD NIXON. 
- JOHNSON spent his final years in retirement in his Texas ranch.

## Analysis 

- Sense of continuity 
- Speech of seduction 

« pursuit » of « happiness » = Declaration of Independence 
land of « plenty » = biblical reference 
consensual rhetoric = combine conservative and progressive elements to show he’s following Kennedy’s principles without alienating conservative voters. 
not « a resting place » = protestant work ethic and also to answer to conservative critics 
nature = Thoreau = consensual 
« equality of opportunity » = one of the motto of the Democratic Partic 
« good life » will inspire Tony Blair « best place to live » = empty term cf. rise of marketing politics = opposing the Democratic party to left radicalism ( Marxists for instance ) ⇒ endorsing capitalism and consumer society, protecting the middle class. 

Jeffersonian criticism of capitalism
Hamiltonian dimension of the city 

Rhetoric innovation ≈ WILSON in U.K 

« dense forests » = ref to ROOSEVELT 
displacing the focus and taking account american students’ criticism on imperialism 

*Ugly american* = book by W.LEDERER & E.BURDICK 

« our Government has many » = allusion to extension of federal powers 

**Issue at stake** : How Johnson defines a consensual approach in a divided country 
- **I ) A progressive stance endorsing and perpetuating Kennedy’s new frontier policy** 
- **II ) Made to appear compatible with conservative values** 
- **III ) Consensual rhetoric with marketing elements**
