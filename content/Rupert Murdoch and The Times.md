# Rupert Murdoch and The Times
***
- **1981** : Purchase of *The Times* by Rupert Murdoch with Thatcher’s support 
- He created *Fox News*
- 800 hundreds companies in 50 countries 
- Controversial figure 
- The idea of a **political-media complex** cf. *Mr. Smith Goes to Washington* ( 1939 )
- In U.S : **polarisation** between *Fox News* & MSNBC 
- Health problems ⇒ succession → battle between brothers = inspired *Succession* HBO TV
- He made his money in the media. 
- He owns *The Sun*, *Fox News*, *The Times* and *The World Street Journal* = tabloïds but also good quality. But well-known for the two. 
- ⚠ avec un sujet sur les média ne pas parler que des réseaux sociaux ⚠ importance de la TV aussi chez les vieux dans la logique de polarisation.

## Fox News 

**⇒ The history of Fox News**
- Context of the rise in partisanship in US’s media 
- **1949** : Beginning of the « **fairness doctrine** » after WWII because technological limitation of the number of TV channels and radio stations. So any TV channel or radio station had to cover the news in a balanced way. 
- But by the **1980s** technological improvements ( ↗ cable TV ) ⇒ vast number of channels and stations ⇒ **1987** : end of the « fairness doctrine » ⇒ The Rush LIMBAUGH radio show started in **1988** ( active until his death in 2021 ). 

**⇒ The fake scandal about Dominion voting’s softwares** 
- Company behind voting machines’software 
- TRUMP claimed that they were rigged ⇒ *Fox News* repeated the fake news 
- *Dominion voting* sued TRUMP but no trial because *Fox News* decided to settle for $ 800m because some facts were becoming public <u>Ex</u> : former Fox News anchor Tucker CARLSON’s texts ⇒ *Fox News* fired him. So there are limits to the quantity that *Fox News* can broadcast without costs. Not an ethical decision but a commercial decision because of the risk of new scandals. 

**⇒ Fox News following Donal Trump for commercial reasons**
- **2016** : *Fox News* covered the Republican primary elections. At the beginning they described DT as a « con-man with no political agenda ». 
- It took several years for *Fox News* to become a media supporting DT, indeed.  

## The Sun 

**⇒ Can the press swing elections ?**
- Famous cover in **1992** ( à ajouter )
- **1992** : Everybody was expecting for the Conservative Party to lose. *The Sun* aggressively campaigned for John MAJOR and the Conservative won ! They proclaimed « **It’s the sun wot won it** ». 
- MURDOCH from Australia invited Tony BLAIR to discuss. He whistles, Blair runs…
- **1997** : *The Sun* decided to support Tony BLAIR. Labour won. 
- Alastair CAMPBELL = TB’s **spin doctor**. Before he was he worked at the *Daily Mirror* ( = Labour Tabloïd ). 
- So, it seems like **the press can swing elections**. 

**⇒ The press’s interest to exaggerate its power**
- *The Sun* followed the changes of public opinion. 
- The economic interest of *The Sun* is to have the largest amount of voters, indeed. 

## The Daily Mail and the « press lords »

- **1896** : Alfred HARMSWORTH created the ***Daily Mail*** ( still exist today ) = **1<sup>st</sup> ½ penny paper**.
- It attracted mass with very short and simple articles and a **strong sensationalist bias**. 
- PM SALISBURRY ( Cons. ) described the *DM* as a « **paper by office boys for office boys** ». 
- They sold extremely well while the well-educated press ( *The Times* ) was struggling. 
- **1908** : HARMSWORTH bought *The Times* = the popular press was more powerful and more politically influent than the quality press. 
- AM → Lord NORTHCLIFFE ( = the establishment used to integrate powerful outsiders ) and 2 others « **press lords** » ! 
- **1931** : Lord BEAVERBROOK and Lord ROTHERMERE ( = the two press lords ) offered their support to the Cons PM Stanley BALDWIN in exchange to decide who is gonna be minister ! BALDWIN said no ! ⇒ limits to the press’powers. 

## Is social media a threat for democracy ? 

**⇒ Social media intensified an existing problem** 
- If the question is asked, one implicit premise is = **social media tend to generate fake news**. But **fake news are not absolutely new and existed before** social media <u>Ex</u> : **1938** : film director Orson WELLES read HG WELL’s 1898 sci-fi novel entitled *War of the Worlds* on the radio.
- But **with social media there is no gatekeepers** ( role played by ethic journalists in the press ). 
- Social media intensified the problem but it was there before. 
- Role of the **echo chamber created by algorithms**. People are exposed with ideas reinforcing what they think. 
- The media can **entrench views** and to **move the Overton window** 

**⇒ *Understanding media*** 
- **1964** : *Understanding media* by Marshall McLUHAN = « **the medium is the message** » <u>Ex</u> : limitation of characters on twitter. 
- **1960** : 1<sup>st</sup> presidential debate televised opposing KENNEDY & NIXON. They were neck and neck but KENNEDY. People who watched on TV the debate thought that NIXON won, people who listened the debate on radio thought the opposite.  

**⇒ McLUHAN applied to social media** : 
- Brief format ⇒ lack of nuance ( because not enough space )
- Increased speed ⇒ impedes quality control

**⇒ The question of media regulation**
- **Liberty of press = 1<sup>st</sup> Amendment ⇒ touchy issue** 
- JEFFERSON defended that he would chose between the second option between a « government without newspapers » and « **newspapers without a government** ». But this view seems outdated… 
- We tend to prefer **self regulation** rather than state regulation. But also tricky because **sensationalism and confirming people’s prejudices** are commercial. 
- **Regulation by the state**. Facebook claims that the company that makes paper is not responsible of what it is printed of the paper. But this argument is less and less accepted by government. Because social media do do something : they write the algorithms ! ⇒ some responsibility.
