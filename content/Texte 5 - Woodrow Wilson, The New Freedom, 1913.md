# Woodrow Wilson, *The New Freedom*, 1913
***
## Introduction 

He became President but that’s odd because the **Democratic Party** was a regional party in the **Solid South**. The Democrats should not have been able to win. Why did WILSON won ? 

**1912’s election** : 
- W. WILSON (D)
- TAFT (R)
- Th. ROOSEVELT (« Progressive Party »)

Time of **political realignment** : the 3 candidates all presented themselves as Progressives. 
- **Gilded Age** **(Civil War-1890s)** ⇒ big business ⇒ ↗ wealth ⇒ ↗ inequalities 
- **Progressivism** **(Late 1890s-WWI)** ⇒ demand of protection of the citizen/consumer by the State. Maybe a stronger state was desirable. Fear of monopolies. 

Th. **ROOSEVELT** = Rep + 1st Progressive President, 1901-08. **Trust-buster** 

**TAFT**. President from 1908-1913. « Progressive » but closer to big business. 

ROOSEVELT wanted to be elected (refuted WASHINGTON’s precedent because he was vice-president when he was named President, because MCKINLEY was shot). He was also an ecologist (cf. [[UK and environment]]) but TAFT don’t care. He fired one of ROOSEVELT’s guys and the trust-buster decided to run. So WILSON managed to win because TAFT lost ! 

WILSON : 
- Installed a movie theatre ⇒ 1st film he watched = *The Birth of a nation*, 
- He was a **southern american** ⇒ racist, approved KKK, etc. 

**Issue at stake** : the nature of WILSON’s progressive stance. 

## <u>I. A self-destructive free market</u>

### A ) « Our prosperity »

**Gilded Age ⇒ phenomenal economic growth** 
- Conquest of the **West** 
- **↗ of the workforce** (natural growth + immigration)
- Thanks to **↗ of productivity** the ↗ was faster that demography ⇒ ↗ level of life 
- Shifts in the structure of business from privately own businesses to corporations 

Indeed, **good american engineers applied European sciences** to make business
- <u>Ex</u> : CARNEGIE adopted the BESSMER process discovered in Europe. 
- **1876** : Thomas EDISON’s Menlo Park, invention factory 
- **1885** : the 1st skyscraper = The Home Insurance Building in Chicago. Not existing in Europe. Innovation because **the walls are not load-bearing**. 

The **rise of the corporations** = a company that can create and sale shares 

### B ) But plutocratic power 

**Economic leaders have now political influence** and are consulted (cf. HAMILTON ideas on cooperation between political and economic elites). 
- <u>Ex</u> : **lang grants** to railroad companies. The government paid the railroads companies in lands. 
- And also **tariffs**. The business world supported the tariff that US’s domestic market was so huge that there was no need to export. So they do not feared retaliation tariffs…
- **1873** : « **The crime of ‘73** » = **demonetisation of silver**. No a detail at all ! Something like a deflationary policy (↘M). Devastating for the people in debt (= rural world).

**Bad industrial relations** 
- **1877** : The **Great Railroad strike** = railroads workers burning trains and railroads. Huge level of pressure and violence… Lot of social unrest. 
- **1892** : The state militia comes to put an end to violence between the Homestead strikers and the Pinkertons (= private police force), obviously on CARNEGIE’s side. 
- **1893** : Repression of the Pullman Strike of 1893.

## Bonus on progressivism

- The **primary election** (<strike>machine</strike>) 
- The **recall** = procedure to fire an elected official before the end of his term 
- The **initiative** (referendum d’initiative populaire)

According to progressivism, things are not simple (≠ populism). We can improve a situation with the help of **experts** ⇒ **technocratic dimension**. 
- <u>Ex</u> : Jane ADDAMS’s Hull House in Chicago (founded 1889)
- The « **Wisconsin idea** » = close links between politicians and academics <u>Ex</u> : Robert LA FOLLETTE (governor) and John COMMONS (economist)

Good to know the debate between : 
- **Preservationism** : nature must be protected for itself and be kept pristine 
- **Conservationism** : nature = useful, sustainable development 

technological breakthrough 

- To be accountable before sb
