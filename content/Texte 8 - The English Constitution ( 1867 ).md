The main originality : division between the dignified parts and the efficients parts
dignified parts = monarchy, HOL ⇒ their role is to impress and excite, trigger the support of the population. They don’t make political decisions.
efficients = Cabinet, HOC ⇒ 
His book contributed to the legitimise and strengthen the prominent role of the HOC in Britain’s politics

- right to be consulted 
- right to encourage 
- right to warn
