# The American reaction Israel-Hamas war
***
Why America supports Israel ? 
- Historical reasons : America provided military arms to Israel during previous conflicts 
- Geopolitical reasons : Israel counters the anti-West influence of countries like Iran 
- Largest Jewish community in USA but anti-war activists among young people 

Reprise : 
- to advocate (for) stg/doing stg 
- **P**alestine = /aI/ like wine 
- De**fense** 
- Be**ginning** 

Vocabulary : 
- ⚠ Cisjordanie = the West Bank 
- Bande de Gaza = the Gaza Strip 
- Israëlien = Israeli = « Izraeli » avec /eI/ like the the letter « a »
- A **« no boots on the ground » policy** = no US soldiers on the battlefield ( because ✞ american soldiers ⇒ risk of **escalation** ) 

**A change in US discourse** : 
- Hamas’s attack ⇒ US immediately promised total support = « the US has Israel’s back »
- Now, words of nuance & ↗ criticism on the way Israel is managing the situation especially on the level of collateral damage ( = affecting civilians ) 

The **US is very clearly behind Israel** ( sending money, ammunition, helped reinforcing the Iron Dome = anti-rocket system,  deploying its largest aircraft carrier ) **but doubts expressed on Israel’s tactics but also strategy** ( ≈ the US after 9/11 )

Deploying its aircraft carrier = **deterrence** ( = dissuasion ) against Hezbollah in Lebanon. « To anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation, I have one word : Dont. » said BIDEN. 

The US has a sit at the UN security council → ¼ of US’ s vetoes in UN’s history = helping Israel 

Turning point = **Six-Day War** ( where the Arab countries where armed by URSS ) ⇒ US’s new interest ! 

> Israel is the largest American aircraft carrier in the world, it cannot be sunk, does not carry even one American soldier, and is located in a critical region for American national security. – Alexander HAIG ( REAGAN’s Secretary of State )

Republicans and **older Americans have more positive views of Israel**. If you are old, your perception of Israel is influenced by WW2 ( = country for a persecuted people ). If you are young you see Israel as a colonial country ⇒ **Israel’s support in America will dwindle** Also, fossil fuels matters less than in the past ( + lot of shale gas in the US ). 

**Cold war → « The pivot to Asia »** ( change made explicit during OBAMA’s presidency )

 > One of the most important tasks of American staecraft over the next decae will therefore to be lock in a substantially increased investiemnt – diplomation, eco,omoc; strategic and otherwise – in the Asia … ( cf. diapo )
 
BIDEN have step confrontation with China up especially with **a ban on exports of semi-conductors** ( to slow down China’s technological development ). **Continuity between OBAMA, TRUMP & BIDEN’s policies**. TRUMP was more hostile in words but BIDEN is more effective in struggling against CHINA. 

That is why BIDEN leaves no doubt ⇒ **Since September 2022 « Strategic ambiguity »** ( = no official treaty defending the island but sending signals to show Taiwan is an ally ) **toward Taiwan is dead**. 

Not absolute pivot because at the moment, US is providing a lot of money to Ukraine in a long lasting war. Same with the middle East. 

- Helping Israel and Ukraine ⇒ risk of **overstretch**. 
- **But they doesn’t have really the choice**… Because China is rising and is tempted to believe that the US is declining in the world ⇒ it matters to US to show it is still capable to determine the face of the world and support its allies. <u>Ex</u> : OBAMA declared in 2012 that US were not going to intervene unless el Assad used chemical weapons. But he actually did and US did nothing…

## Israel and the BBC 

After Hamas’ massacre **BBC refused to call Hamas a « terrorist group »**. Weird because : 
- Terrorism is a mode of action and it corresponds to Hamas’ attacks 
- UK listed Hamas as a terrorist organisation 

But BBC claimed to be respecting **neutrality**. They eventually changed their position and moreover they interviewed people saying and not saying that the Hamas is a terrorist organisation.  

**⇒ Chuck SCHUMER (Jewish Senate majority leader) started piling pressure on Netanyahu (march 2023)**
