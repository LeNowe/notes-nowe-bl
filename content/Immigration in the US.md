# Immigration in the US
***
US-Mexico border over 700km long 
BIDEN’s U-turn = hardening of his policy  ?

Yuval Noah HARARI, *21 lessons for the 21st century*, 3 main debates on immigration 

1m newcomers/year (≈ 1890s) ⇒ current waves are not the biggest (because greater population)

US accepted **hyphenated Americans** (=stg-American) ≠ FR’s obsession of integration 

Hispanics are divided between  
- Cuban (Rep)
- Mexican (Dem)

Today, **the risk of terrorism in US is associated with white nationalism**. 

Today, **the debate on immigration is also a debate on the federal state’s power** ⇒ the populist want to « **take back control** » (slogan of the Brexit campaign). 

Deploring immigration is a **good way for Republicans to mobilise their base** (because now the abortion has been settled by the SC…). So electoral and tactical reasons. 

That’s odd because the **establishment Republicans (1945-2016) had at least mixed view about immigration**. 
- Because the Rep was the **Business party** and Business needs immigration. 
- **WASP’s party**  

**1980s** : REAGAN legalised 3m illegal immigrants 

The Republican Party from 1990 to 2016
- **Proto-populist rhetoric to mobilise voters** (including poor voter)
- **Delivered pro-business and pro rich policies** (low taxes)

It worked for a long term ! But **TRUMP was clearly more interest with the populist side**  ! 

cf. *The Economist* cover of January 2024. 
- **Anti-globalisation agenda** 
- **Uncertainty about policies ⇒ ↘ I** 

**According TRUMP immigrants are terrorist/rapist/mental**
- **2015** : « They’re rapist » (speech about Mexican)
- **2023** : « It’s poisoning the blood of our country »

**TRUMP is political weathercock** (girouette) ⇒ he denounces immigration because it works ! 

Today, **lot of illegal immigration and US is badly dealing with it** (because **the system is built too small**, not enough judges) ⇒ need of funding. 

**You cannot reduce the influx !** It’s a duty to examine an asylum application. TRUMP and BIDEN tried to examine the applications in Mexico = **subcontract the management of immigration to Mexico**. It cannot work because Mexico is deluged with immigrants too ! 

In the mind of the voter, the arbitration is not between legal and illegal immigration but **between legal immigration and no immigration**. 

But how to reduce immigration ? **Foreign aid** for countries of origins. But politically, not going to happen… Besides, diversification of immigrants’ origins ⇒ bigger need of aids. 

It is also a **humanitarian crisis** (especially in border states ⇒ local states are struggling to deal with it). **Republican-led southern states sent immigrants to northern ones in buses**. Demagogic but also get a point (harder for norther Democrats to say it is not a problem). 

**Immigration is a wedge issue for democrats** ⇒ divided between :
- Middle class/« Woke » not fearing competition with immigrants
- A section of the white working class/More conservative
