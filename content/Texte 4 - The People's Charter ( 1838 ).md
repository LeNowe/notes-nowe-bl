# Text 4 - The People’s Charter ( 1838 )

## Introduction 

one year after the beginning of Victoria’s reign 
Text about chartism 

### The causes of the movement 

Working conditions in factories were terrible in terms of security. They were many accidents ⇒ workers were dissabled or killed. 
Dissabled ⇒ indigent ⇒ workhouses 
Everybody were working in factories ( me, women, chidren )
Also terrible living conditions : infection diseases ( lack of hygiene ) like Cholera or TB
There was no sewage system 
Lot of houses were wooden houses ( take fire easily )
⇒ 1834 : New Poor Law ⇒ anger ( if you lost your job you could end up in a workhouse ) ⇒ huge source of concern for the working class 
Also the Reform Act of 1832 
The social atmosphere was extremely tensed ⇒ pave the way for the creat° of London working men’s association

### How it all started

1836 : creat° of the london working men’s association ( William LOVETT and Francis PLACE, two skilled craftmen from the upper category of the working class ) they we’re supporting to radical MPs wich led to creation of the National Charta Association in ???
Movement composed of craftmen and industry workers ( working class movement )
Their goals in the document 

### The Methods 

The movment was divided over the methods they were planning to use : 
- **Physical force chartists** ⇒ wanted to use organize riots to frighten the gov. They called on general strikes. They wanted to trigger a national scale Revolution. One of their leader : Feargus O’Connor. 
- **Moral force chartists** ⇒ believed in the power of the word, in organizing dialogue through meetings, publishing pamphlet and press. ( Beware, pamphlet = flyer and not satirical work ). Leaders : W.Lovett and F.Place

### The Evolution

The mvmt evolved around 3 petitions organized : 
Each time, the numbers of people signing grows 
- 1838-1839 : 1.2 M ⇒ brought to the MPs and was rejected ⇒ National strike that failed ( repression and people in jail )
- 1842 : creation of a fund,  3.2 M ⇒ rejetcted ⇒ strikes ⇒ repression
- 1848 : 6 M ⇒ same result but they had another plan 

The land plan ( inspired by socialist utopian thinkers ) :
To buy land in the North of England and try to organize a self-sufficient community 
⇒ failed ( the land was not fertile and their plan required a lot of investment )
⇒ End of the Chartist movement. these egalitarian claims faded away and one had to wait to 1867 ( Second Reform Act ) to see an extension of the entitlement to vote.

### Reasons of the failure

Their claims were **too radical for the time** 
Chartist were **divided** and never manage to get the support of the middle class.

## Analysis

#### First point 

they thought women were influenced by the church
21 y.o : majority if you’re underage you’re influenced by your parents and can’t held property
sound mind : at the time, if you were an aristocrate and completely crazy you could vote 
prison : prisonners were not free 

#### Second point 

secret vote to avoid bribery ⇒ the pocket boroughs’ situation 

#### Third point 

At the time all the MPs were landed gentlemen 
Workers wanted to be represented 

#### Fourth point 

to garanty that workers will be able to sit in HOC
the working class was considered as vicious, disgusting 

##### Fifth point 

reference to pocket and rottent boroughs
redistribution of constituencies 

#### Sixth point

imperative mandate 
strictly obey the series of instructions given by electors 
1716 : Septennial Act voted at the time by the Whigs 
1911 : Parliament Act 5-year terms ⇒ prime minister’s role to decide when to organize elections.
2011 : Fixed Term Parliament ⇒ 5 year no less no more 
⇒ impossibility to buy a constituency once in a year 
⇒ annual parliaments’ idea comes from the American R° 

few dates : 
1918 : universal suffrage ( men : 21, woman : 30 )
1938 : full universal suffrage
