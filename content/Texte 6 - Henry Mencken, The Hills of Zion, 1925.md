# Henry Mencken, « The Hills of Zion », 1925
***
The text aims to inform about evangelicalism but also to entertain. 

**The Monkey Trial (1925)**
- Law suit against one teacher (SCOPES) in Tennessee 
- Little event but big scopes (captivated the whole nation)
- Why so much attention ? **It crystallised tensions between modern/urban America and rural/evangelical America** 

**1920s** : **change of America’s status in the World**. It became an acknowledged world power. Emblem also of modern consumer culture (diffusion of credit). Signifiant changes in American everyday lives (in urban America because elsewhere many Americans sax this **onset of modernity as a threat** ⇒ **populism and will to return to the past** (Jeffersonian stance). 

**Darwinism v. biblical fundamentalism** 

In Tennessee the state had passed a law banning the teaching of Darwinism. The **ACLU** (American Civil Liberties Union, association involved in defending of free speech) motivated teachers to create a **test case**. John SCOPES accepted and was sued. The prosecution = William JENNINGS BRYAND.

## <u>I. A divided nation</u>

### A ) « The roaring twenties »

**« automobile » and the « Ford T »** = **spread of consumerism** (thanks to Taylorism and cheap credit). But also massive use of **advertising**. The « **Mad men** » (Mad for Madison Avenue). Advertising focused more on the promotion of a way of life (and not of the usefulness of the product). Influence of Edward BERNAYS, Freud’s nephew. **1929** : he promoted cigarettes for women as « torches of freedom ». He wrote *Propaganda*. 

Car but also reference to **radio** and **movie actors** ⇒ **cultural references on a national level now**. This **nationalisation of America’s culture life** + **rise of big brands** (« Coca-Cola »). **Chain stores** → **Woolworth**. 

Now **white Americans listening to jazz** (**deghettoisation of black culture**). 

The « **bobbed hair** » → the « **flapper** » (not so much women but image everywhere)

⚠ Everybody was no the Great Gatsby but everybody knew some were living like this. 

### B ) The backcountry 

Changes have not happened everywhere and created a **backlash**. Changes were not perceived as good things in the backcountry. 

**Dayton, a backcountry**
- In Tennessee = 2000 habitants 
- Dayton ∈ « South » → backward
- West of the Appalachians 
- But still urbanised in comparison with rural Tennessee

**Local inhabitants are less touched than most people by the consumer society**. Perceived negatively by MENCKEN. Modern cult of appearance. Portrait of **redneck** (≠ virtuous farmer but primitive idiot). 

Big **attachment to religion**. The trip to Tennessee is presented like a **trip back in time**. 

## <u>II. Discrediting evangelicalism</u>

### A ) « Old-time religion »

**Great Awakening** 
- ≈ 1720s
- ≈ 1830s

**Main features of evangelicalism**
 - **Repressiveness of religion** (banning Coca-Cola but also pies and bought meat). 
 - But also **reject of rationalism**
 - **Emphasis on emotions** (fears, sins) = evangelical sermons during Great Awakening with graphic descriptions of what awaits sinners in Hell ⇒ **inarticulate** form of religion (the **« gif of tongues »** or *glossolalia* = language of angels) = **protestant thing** 
 - **Disorganised/spontaneous form of religion** 

### B ) Unknowingly proving Darwin right 

**Animalisation = comparing local evangelicals as animals** (chicken, an ox). Description of **primitives** (uncivilised human beings) and **microbes** ⇒ ridiculing the locals ! Describing their sex impulses. 
### C ) A dying culture 

Even Dayton’s drink is made of liquor ! ⇒ **evangelicalism is in decline** 

**1920** : 18<sup>th</sup> amendment ⇒ **prohibition** 
- Improve public virtue (≈ progressive/populist ideas)
- Policy pushed by nativist (recent immigrants = alcoholic)  

But evangelicalism’s death is not so sure ! 

In the 1920s = appearance of **new modern forms of religion**  
- First **mega-churches** + radio ⇒ The Foursquare church (LA) with Aimee Mac PHERSON 
- **1930** : The **HAYS** code (≠ law) in Hollywood = extremely moralistic and conservative 
- **1920s** : golden age for the **KKK** ⇒ became an organisation persecuting blacks but also anybody perceived as a threat to traditions (immigrants, catholic)
