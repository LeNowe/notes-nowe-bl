## History 

### 1. Slavery and the Westward movement 

Westward movement and slavery ⇒ violent debates in order to decide the nature of the soil ( free or slave state ). 

**1783** : **Treaty of Paris** ⇒ UK’s territories became US’s territories ⇒ the royal charters did not apply anymore so what status ? Free state or slave state ? States had unclear western boundaries… It was decided not to expand westward the existing states but to increase the number of states. 

**1787** : The **Northwest Ordinance** drafted by JEFFERSON. It clarified the conditions. A new state needed. 
- 60k male inhabitants
- A Republican form of government 
- Freedom of religion 
- No slavery ( JEFFERSON’s hope to phase out slavery )

The NO Ordinance only applied : 
- East of the Mississippi ( because Louisiana belong to France )
- North of the Ohio river 

**1790** : NO’s application for the territories in the South of the Ohio = same conditions except slavery. 

**1803** : **Louisiana Purchase** ≈ ⅓ of the country ⇒ doubling the size of the U.S  at the time 

Missouri was the first territory west of the Mississipi getting big enough to become a state. At that time the status quo between slave interests ( = defenders of slavers )/abolitionist interests ⇒ the nature of Missouri became a political issue. 

**1820** : **Missouri Compromise** to preserve the balance in Congress
- Dual admission 
- Dividing line = 36 30’

**1836** : Congress passed the « **gag rule** » = we are not allowed to debate on slavery. 

**1846-1848** : **Mexican-American war** ⇒ U.S won ⇒ transfer California, Utah, New Mexico, Texas ⇒ again, what should we do with these territories ! 

**1849** : **Discovery of Gold in California** ⇒ quick ↗ population ( enough to become a state ). Slave = useful only to produce cotton/tobacco ⇒ need a humid ( hot and rainy ) climate. Hence, in California slavery couldn't work. 

**Compromise of 1850** 
- California as a free state 
- **Fugitive Slave Act** ≠ radical invention but strengthened existing laws ⇒ free states were forced to cooperate with slave owners by sending backs runaway slaves. 

Slave owners were fearing to losing grounds in the West and radicalise. 

**1854** : **Kansas-Nebraska Act** decided that the choice of being free soil or slave soil had to be given to « popular sovereignty » = **partial dismantlement of the Missouri Compromise**. 

**1857** : **Dred Scott v. Sandford** stated 2 things 
- Dred Scott couldn’t be free (ok they can decide)
- Missouri Compromise ≈ unconstitutional (⚠ 2nd time since Marbury v. Madison in 1803)

Appearance of **slave interests’ victories**. But time was nevertheless playing in favour of the abolitionist interest (for climate reasons). 

### 2. Sharecropping 

Slaves legally freed but had no capital ⇒ to live as farmers had to rent land/tools/seeds. 
They were allowed to borrow to those things in exchange of giving a part of their crop to the renters ≈ diluted form of slavery. Because implicit interest rate so high ⇒ impossible to create surplus ⇒ can’t access to property. 

### 3. Military Reconstruction 

**1865** **End of the Civil war ⇒ paradox because North Victory ( in favour of national unity ) but ↗ southern animosity** ( so national unity = further than before ) ⇒ question of the **reintegration of secessionist states** = « **reconstruction** » of the Union ( only political sense ). 

« **Presidential reconstruction** » = reintegration of the South under **JOHNSON**’s presidency ( southerner with a very lenient view of reconstruction  ). According to him, no more slavery was enough to reintegrate. He **condoned the « black codes »** ( **1865-7** ) = state laws limiting blacks’ right trying to keep the spirit of slavery  without its letter. 

« **Congressional reconstruction** » = restructuring the society by giving to black the status of citizens. But the Congress disagreed with JOHNSON. It was entirely composed  of Republican politicians and especially a lot of Radical Republicans. 

They organised the **Military reconstruction Act** of **1867** that stated that the south would be administered by the Federal army 
- To protect blacks from physical violence 
- To organise elections in which only blacks and loyalist whites could vote 

It was a **success in the short term** ! Blacks voted and some of them were elected (1 in federal Senate = Hiram REVELS) ⚠ no « black rule » ( = white supremacist reconstruction in the 20<sup>th</sup> century ). 

But in the medium term it proved a failure. Economic and social planters remained in the hands of the planters. In few years, southern politics became again dominated by the **Democratic party** = **return of the** « **Solid South** ». 

**1876-1877** : The Federal Army eventually withdrew ⇒ **1876-1896** : the **Redemption** = recreating oppression through Jim CROW Laws & segregation.
