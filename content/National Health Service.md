# The NHS
***
- **1948** under ATTLEE’s gov 
- « **national religion** » in U.K 
- **1989** : **decentralisation Act** ⇒ each nation is responsible of its own NHS 
- **2020** : historical crisis linked to under-investment and Covid-19  
- Currently strikes of junior doctors from the BMA (=*Bristih Medical Association*) for higher wages 
- Operations and appointments cancelled

**A « national religion »**. Religious service celebrating the NHS where Sir Keir Starmer and Sunak read Bible extracts for the 75<sup>th</sup> birthday . **The Queen gave to the NHS the George Cross**. The NHS was also presented in 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London with the Queen and James Bond. 

> The NHS is the closest thing the English have now to a religion. – Nigel LAWSON, Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 1980s. 

**BEVERIDGE’s five giants in his 1942 report**. State had no responsibility to take care of health. There were self employed doctors and philanthropic hospitals. But the system was not able to deal with the increase of medical costs. With the market doctors were going in affluent area. BEVERIDGE tried to tackle theses issues by creating a system « **free at the point of delivery** » (= you do not have to pay for these services at the time of receiving them) = **complete nationalisation of health services** in Britain (GP forced to be employee of the State). 

The *British Medical Association* resisted a lot defending a **vested interest**. BEVAN said « **I stuff their mouth with gold** » = high wages for doctors ⇒ **5 July 1948** : access to health became affordable for everyone. 

Beveridge wrote a preface to his report to make it interesting to the ordinary citizen = « **the 5 giants** ». He knew that if you put his scheme into practice it would imply taxes and perhaps discontent. 

**⇒ John BUNYAN, *The Pilgrim’s Progress*, 1678** = everybody in 1940s knew this book = christian fiction where the main character is looking for the city of God but faces 5 giants before ⇒ BEVERIDGE’s projet of a heaven on earth.

But the NHS is struggling, currently confronted with general discontent and many **strikes**. Why ? **Their demands focuses on pay raises**. **Indeed 2008 → 2023 : real wages ↘ 25-30%**. How this underpay phenomenon developed ? 
- **2008** : The **subprime crisis** ⇒ ↘ state’s budget & ↗ state’s expenditures ⇒ **budget deficit** making harder to raise the pay of  NHS’s workers. 
- **2010** : end of New Labour government replaced by David CAMERON’s conservative government obsessed with financial discipline ⇒ **policy of austerity** eroding the wages of the staff. 

Today, **inflation** is taking off ⇒ **strong deterioration of the purchasing power** of NHS’s worker. Why this **spectacular inflation** ? 
- Covid ⇒ constricted supply & demand did not crash thanks to subsidies 
- War in Ukraine and OPEC 
- <u>Probably</u> brexit because less free trade 

Covid ⇒ pressure on the NHS ⇒ very high rate of **burn-out** **because fewer NHS workers facing the same amount of work** ⇒ burn-out, etc. Moreover, Europeans workers in the NHS decided to go back at home with Brexit… 

Enormous **backlog at the end of the pandemic** (postponed operations etc.) ⇒ enormous amount of pression  & **↗ waiting list** even for A&E (= *Accident and emergency*) and cancer stuff… 

What answer ? More money ? Perhaps.
- **1997** → **2010** : ↗ 5%/y  health expenditure and ↘ waiting list 
- **2010** → **now** : ↗ 2%/y health expenditure and ↗ waiting list 

**NHS always financially struggled** ! BEVERIDGE made a huge mistake from the beginning. He was a **liberal** ≈  left-wing party before Labour. He was fascinating by the social questions but a old man ( born in **1879** ) ⇒ <b>XIX<sup>th</sup> century man</b>. 
- According to him, the Welfare State (including the NHS) should not be funded by general taxation and **insisted on national insurance contributions**. 
- The contributions should not **means-tested** ( = faire l’objet de conditions de ressources ) to avoid the risk of stigmatisation of the freeriders but also to avoid discontent from the rich. 
- National insurance contribution based on a <b>flat <strike>rate</strike></b>  = **flat sum** ⇒ everybody pay the same amount. **Not a redistributive system but compulsory insurance**. But how high ? The sum was set at a low level ⇒ **weak budget by construction** ! too small to pay ! 
- **1952** : « **Prescription charges** » ⇒ <strike>free at the point of delivery</strike> = charges on medications 
- But today the overwhelming majority of NHS’s funds is general taxation ⇒ the rich pay more than they get ⇒ ↘ political support to the NHS from the rich… 

Impossible to find enough money because **the demand for health services is expanding faster than the NHS’s ressources !**  Why ? 
- ↗ life expectancy ⇒ ↗ health services demand 
- ↗ lifetime conditions <u>Ex</u> : obesity 
- **Health is a superior good !** 

How to improve the situation ? 
- **Productivity gains** <u>Ex</u> : IA and radiologists ± fantasy (cf. cost disease, BAUMOL). 
- **Managerial reorganisation**. But it has been tried since 1980s and yet no miracle… and « **marketisation of public services** » introduced experimentally in 1980s. Denounced the lack of incitations and competition in public services but acknowledged that privatisation would imply large inequalities… System where the state still pays hospitals and not people but in proportion of its demand. Not obvious that it works…
- **Financing local-council** to help temporarily disabled people staying in hospital to get home early. But ↘ central grants since 2000s and other ressources (local business rates and council taxes for residents) depend on the area…
