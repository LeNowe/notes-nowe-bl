## Analysis 

- Common economic interest between whites and blacks 

> Cast down your bucket. 

To blacks : Stay where you are and improve your economic conditions ≠ go to the North 
To whites : Hire « my people », they will be obedient 

> In all things social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.

He accepts segregation. 

*The Protestant work ethic* 

( l. 32-33 ) Quote from a famous anti-slavery poem by John Greenleaf Whittier ( quaker, abolitionnist figure ). Show to the North that the South is pacified.  

Messianic dimension reminiscent ( « new heaven & new earth » ) refers to Winthrop, *A model of Christian charity* 
American exceptionalism : *A city upon a Hill* John Winthrop
