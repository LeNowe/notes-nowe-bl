# George Wallace, Inaugural Address, 1963
***
**⇒ The NAACP**
- Created by WEB DUBOIS
- **1909** : Created after a lynching in Springfield, Illinois (not in the South ! where Lincoln was born)
- Worked against segregation but couldn’t challenge it in itself (pragmatic and gradual approach) 
- Focused on legal cases 

**1954** : **BROWN v. Topeka** 
- The NAACP supporting BROWN argued that even in itself segregation = unconstitutional 
- It should implied desegregation everywhere, « with all deliberate speed » 
- The South did not try to desegregate anything and the the Fed gov was not doing efforts 

**1956** : **The Southern Manifesto** 
- Denunciation of the SC ruling 
- The South promise to resist against the Fed gov if it tried to desegregate 

**The Civil Rights movement** : 
- **1963** : March on Washington + MLK Birmingham campaign (Alabama) = peaceful demonstration in most segregated town in the US ⇒ would lead to extreme policy brutality = necessary for MLK to force the nation to realise something has to be done. 

George WALLACE’s speech : 
- Not focus on segregation but broader 

> Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever. 
## <u>I. Censuring an allegedly authoritarian federal State</u>

### A ) A defence of the Constitution 

WALLACE just had been elected = speech delivered in the name of all Alabama’s representatives. The **government is described as something that oppresses the people**. 
- **1962** : JFK’s Executive Order banning discrimination in housing 

**JFK was prudent concerning the support of the CRM**
- **1960** : He secured the liberation of the MLK 
- But after his election he did not much to desegregate (still racist southerners in its electorate) 
- He became proactive after pushed by the CRM’s pressure 
- **June 1963** : JFK’s Civil Rights Address 

Mentioning « Jefferson DAVIS » (president of the Confederation) = suggesting that **secession is still possible** ! 

### B ) A defence of Christian values 

**1962** : ENGEL v. VITALE SC ruling 

  
- Ref to “**Engel v. Vitale**” (62): school days opened with a **non-denominational** prayer ⇒ debate if creates pb with **1st Amendment** (no established church, freedom of relig°) only ⇒ yes for SC
- Claims that US created as a **Christian theocracy** by founding fathers ⇒ current gvt trying to dechristianize
- Lims: most of references to relig° in US introduced after WW2 in context of **Cold War** to stress contrast with atheistic USSR:
- Jefferson – “**wall of sep°**” between state & church (VS-UK)
- “**In God we trust**”: national moto in 56, “E pluribus unum” before
- no federal law requiring to swear on the Bible on **Induct° Day**: precedent by **Washington** (in **NY State**: a state law asking to take any oath on a Bible) only accidental
- Only refce to religion: **1st **Amendment**: relig° purely individual
- US democratic experiment **freed all** men (≠ Eur) ⇒ risk of **anarchy** ⇒ democracy only possible with high **civic virtue** (meaning **Christian morality** ⇒ associat° not clear in Const° (≠ in founding fathers’ writings))
- “a personal God”: < **evangelicalism** (no mediat° God<->believer) ⇒ was powerful in Sth (where Wallace comes from)

### C ) A conspiracist vision

- Claim: Fed gvt wants to **replace God**
- gvt is not aiming to **help individuals** but to **dominate** over them: Social Security (strange coming from a Democrat), economic intervent° (↗ grip on lives)
- **Liberalism**:
	- not used in US before **Progressive Age**
    - 1st meaning: **small gvt** for free individuals
	- 2nd meaning: shifted by **FDR**: **4 freedoms** (of speech, of worship, from want, from fear) ⇒ State should **protect people** to make freedom tangible
- No reason to be grateful: gvt 1st **stole** from people (taxat°) wealth that gives us ⇒ discourages people to work hard ⇒ less tax revenue ⇒ **vicious circle** ⇒ will end up **authoritarian**

## <u>II. An expression of Southern sectionalism</u>

### A ) The « lost cause of the Confederacy »

- Vis° of 19th C developed just **after Civil War**, widely **accepted** in Sth & even in Nth mid 20th Cy
- “the great War **Between the States**” ⇒ inaccurate: Fed state v. secessionist states (illegally), fought over **slavery** (VS-defense of state’s rights)
- Describes Sth as a **victim** which Fed state tried to destroy
- Even in those harsh circumstances real Sers still upheld the only thing worth it: revering **God** ⇒ **aristocratic/Romantic** mindset (VS-pragmatism)
- “**lost cause of the Confederacy**”: Sers quickly realized that they were going to lose fight to defend states ⇒ but **still fought** on ⇒ no reason to change after (& become selfish as Ners)
- Sth Carolina: **confederate flag** on Capitol 2000
- cf _Gone with the wind_ ⇒ also popular in the Nth ⇒ ex of losers rewriting history: still Confederate generals’ statues in Nth

### B ) Underlying racial stakes

- Defends “separate but equal” as a **tool of liberty**: people should have the right not to mix with the rest
- 57: integrat° of **High School in Little Rock** (Arkansas): governor sent national guard to physically stop AfAms from entering ⇒ Eisenhower **federalized** National Guard through an executive order & sent Fed troups
- 62: // with Meredith defended by army to enter univty of Mississippi
- 63: Wallace “stand in the schoolhouse door” to prevent AfAms
- takes poverty of the Sth as example of communism not going along with poverty ⇒ in fact it actually stabilized **white society**:
- **W.E.B. DuBois**: many white Sers would have also benefited from change (white proletariat or sharecroppers) but could still see themselves as winners (dominant race, could insult/abuse/lynch Blacks) relatively, “**wages of whiteness**” (increase of status, symbolic) ⇒ slave society (VS-society with slaves)
- still the case with segregat°: removal would lead to destabilizat°
- Associates segregat° with **biology** (blood): Sth = “heart of Anglo-Saxon Southland” ⇒ no real place for AfAms there

### C ) The southern « nation »

- “**my people**”
- **ashamed** at behavior of some Sers ⇒ sens of aristocratic honor
- Southern stereotypes 

## <u>III. A potential political realignment</u>

Points of contacts between some Rep and some Dem ⇒ makes possible for Southern Democrats to vote for the Rep. 
### A ) Populist rhetoric 

**⇒ Populism’s ingredients**
- People v. politicians 
- ∃ « the people » 
- Demonisation of « elites »
- Self-serving system made by the elites 
- Unpatriotic 

### B ) A nationwide appeal 

WALLACE did originate from working class. He equals « South » and freedom ⇒ **appealing to all the electorate** (whites from the North too) ⇒ leaving the orbit of the Dem.  

**1965** : **Watts riots** (LA)

### C ) Some proximity with certain aspects of the Republican ideology

- No praise of nation-wide ND Dems  
- **Conspiracist approach of anticommunism**
- **Anti-tax rhetoric** and non-interventionist government 
- Distinction between « **individual rights** »/« **human rights** » (the State intervenes)

According, the South will be decisive in the next election ⇒ the South might swing from one party to the other. Indeed, in **1964** the South voted for **Barry GOLDWATER**. 

WALLACE became a new-born evangelist in the 1970s ⇒ **changed his white supremacist views**. John LEWIS wrote an obituary in 1988 forgiving WALLACE.
