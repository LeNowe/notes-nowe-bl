# Dublin’s attack
***
- Teacher and little girl stabbed by an Irish man with Algerian origins 
- Anti-immigrant and racist violences 
- Lot of fake news 
- Conor McGregor 
- Housing crisis and ↗ living cost 
- Lot of inequalities 

**23 November 2023** : act of rioting by **far-right activist = most violent incident since decades**. But not very violent historically. Nobody died. Max 500 hundred people. 3 policemen injured and some shops damaged. 

But **Dublin and Southern Ireland tented to be peaceful** and have **no sectarian conflict**. 
- Southern Ireland remained mainly catholic after the English Reformation in the 16<sup>th</sup> 
- Britain decided to control it to avoid a french-irish catholic attack by colonising Ireland during 17<sup>th</sup> 
- Small farm in the North ( fertile land ⇒ scottish farmers → protestant ) and big farms ( less fertile land ⇒ scottish big owners but lot of Irish farmers ). 
- **1922** : The partition of Ireland. 

It is also a **prosperous place** ( richer than UK *per capita* )
- Very **moderate corporate tax** : 12,5% ⇒ ↗ corporate headquarters to pay lower taxes 
- So the wealth is an optical illusion ⇒ **GDP > GNI** 
- Ireland’s GDP fluctuates highly ! 
- Ireland is nearly a **tax haven** <u>Ex</u> : Apple is at Dublin ! 

The **Irish Republic’s values have changed** :
- **Historically conservative catholic values**
- **1983** :  amendment adopted by referendum to outlaw abortion except possible mother’s ✞
- **2018** : Amendment made possible to have on-demand abortion up to the 12<sup>th</sup> week of a pregnancy 
- **Taoiseach ( = PM ) Leo VARADKAR** = openly gay ( society liberalised )

So **Southern Ireland became a normal western country**. 

**Immigration (and especially non-white) is recent**. 

But **today anti-immigration speechs are marginalised in politics**. Indeed it tends to be defended by ethno-nationalist party. Ireland has had for a long time a ethno-nationalist party (**Sinn Féin**) but it was a far-left and anti-imperialist one.
