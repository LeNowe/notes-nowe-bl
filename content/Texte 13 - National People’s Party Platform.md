# Texte 13 - National People’s party Platform <br>( 1892 )
***
## Context 

**Economic trends at that time**
- **1880s** : agriculture’s crisis especially in Kansa ( = droughts destroying harvests ) ⇒ farmers became indebted. Some lost their plot of lands to big landowners. 
- They were the victims of the « middle man » that took much of the profit. 
- Farmers discriminated by railway companies. They had to pay the full price whereas several categories profited of rebates. 
- Created a lot of resentment against railroads, banking sector and industry. Emerged the idea that they were a victim of a conspiracy organised by industrial elites. 
- In the South : farmers ruined by the Civil War. They were merely tenants. 
- **1890s** : debates on protectionism.
- **1890** : Mc KINLEY Act = protectionist measure that introduced high tariffs ⇒ decrease of agricultural imports and caused depression ⇒ foreclosures and unemployment ⇒ strikes !! 
- **1893** : Panic that started with a bankruptcy in London ⇒ krach. 

**It led to the creation of a large number of short live organisations**
- **1860s** : The Granger movement created in Washington DC = rural organisation of farmers modelled on the masonic order ( + women ). Two purposes :
	- **Cultural** : improve the intellectual life of its members. Organised debates, lectures, reading clubs and also small schools. 
	- **Economic** : encourage associations between farmers to circumvent the « middle man ». Created local corporatives, their own stores, mutual insurance companies. 
	- **1870s** : 1m. members 
	- But their initiatives failed… ⇒ **1880s** : movement faded away
- **1870s** : Farmers’ Alliance movement composed of 3 alliances ≈ 5m. members. Also had an educational purpose. But also a political aspect = promoting cooperation & promoting anti-monopolistic policies.
	- National Farmers’ Alliance ( West )
	- National Farmers’ Alliance and Union ( South, whites only )
	- Coloured Farmers’ National Alliance and Cooperative Union ( South - Blacks )
- They developed political claims. They tried to form one single organisation but they failed…
- They developed a platform in order to influence politicians : they advocated 
	- Creation of a graduated income tax putting an end to large land holding. 
	- Nationalisation of railroads companies and telegraph system = utilities 
	- Lower tariffs = free trade would allow export 
	- Opposed to the Gold Standard and in favour of the Free Cornage of Silver
	- Direct election of judges and senators 

**The Free silver movement**
- ≠ gold Standard 
- Led by **William JENNINGS BRYAN** = candidate for presidential election in **1896**, **1900** and **1908**. 
- Reasoning : Silver ⇒ more money ⇒ inflation in favour of indebted farmers 
- **1870-1880s** : several policies 
	- **1873** : Coinage Act that demonetised silver = « **the crime of 1873** »
	- **1878** : the Bland-Allison Act introduced flexibility by authorising a limited amount of silver money. 
	- **1890** : the Sherman Silver Purchase Act introduced more silver. But repealed after **1893**’s krach. 
- **1896** : candidacy of JENNINGS BRYAN = climax of the movement. 
- **1900** : Congress voted the Gold Standard Act which put an end to their claims. It remained in force until NIXON in **1971**. 
- Who ? Poor farmers, mine owners and mine workers. 
- The opponents : industry + banking sector 

**The Knights of Labour** 
- **1879** : creation of the *Noble and holy order of the Knights of Labour*

- Disappeared at the end of **1890s** 
- **1885** : Successful strike against a railroad company 
- Also a political movement that had candidates for local elections 
- According to them ≈ 700k members 

**The Greenback Labor Party** 
- **1874** : creation 
- Agrarian party. Then included factory workers. 
- Mixture between union and political association. They had congressmen elected. 
- Greenback refers to paper money ( ≈ ideas close to Free silver )
	- Graduated income tax 
	- Nationalisation of railways and utility companies 
	- Opposed to a standing army 
	- Stopping immigration
- **1880** : disappeared after Bland-Allison Act

**The National People’s Party**
- **1891** : creation 
- **1892** : 1st national convention in Nebraska where they adopted the « **Omaha platform** » or the « **2nd Declaration of Independence** » ( claiming to reenact the Declaration of Independence = recurring motif in American politics )

	- Nationalisation of utilities 
	- Direct election of senators 
	- Restriction of immigration
