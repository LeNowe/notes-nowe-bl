# Weapons in the US
***
**Do you think that there is any scope for reducing gun violence in the United States ?** (correction CB1 sujet école de commerces). Kind of sceptical question ! 

Issue of **mass-shootings** (= at least 4 victims shot not including the shooter). After every mass-shootings, the Dem say « we need tighter legislation » and Rep say « no we dont’ » ⇒ **gridlock and ↗ guns’ sales**. 

**2016** : OBAMA cried mentioning a mass-shooting ⇒ reveals incapacity to tackle the problem. 

But **mass shooting deaths ≈ 1% of total gun deaths**. But **mass-shootings are on the rise** in the last years. 

To limit mass shooting you have to : 
- Limit access to **assault weapons** (can fire very large number of bullets in a short amount of time)
- Make **background checks** 

⚠ But **mad people with a machine gun are not the core of the problem** ! But guns deaths are seen in US like car deaths in Europe (because mass sale of something dangerous). 

In US, **45k ✞/year by fire arms** (including suicide). For a useful yardstick, the Vietnam war ⇒ 58k ✞. Around 25k suicides and 20k shootings (not mass ⚠). So banning assault weapons and doing mental illness checks will not help to prevent suicides. 

⚠ Bonneville is going to refute the idea that tighter gun legislation seems impossible because of **America’s gun culture** (Conquest of the West + 2nd Amendment ⇒ very well protected « right to keep and bear arms »). **This is non sense**. 
- 120 firearms/100 residents in America but 34 firearms/100 residents in Canada ⇒ not the role of the Conquest. The **normalisation of guns is a recent phenomenon**. In **1960s the growth of guns  > growth of the population**. 

**2nd amendment’s history** 
- Context of **no army ⇒ need to arm citizens** in case of foreign invasion (consensual amendment)
- **Avoiding to create a permanent armed force in order to avoid tyranny** ⇒ the ruler can use it to oppress the population (America was terrified of creating an authoritarian state) 

But **today, no risk of invasion**. So the necessity to protect the right to bear arms collapses. **The 2nd amendment appears obsolete**. 

**Historically, gun-controls on state level**. But in the **1930s** (prohibition + gangs + Al Capone) the federal gov tried to restrict access to guns ⇒ **1934’s legislation** was challenged before the SC but the SC accepted (2nd amendment applies only to « well regulated militias »). So, the **2nd amendment’s meaning was contested**. It was considered as a **collective right**. 

But the SC became gradually more conservative and its interpretation has changed. **In the mid-1990s, jurisdictional U-turn** ⇒ it became considered as a **individual right**. 
- **2008** : Washington DC v. HELLER ⇒ the SC endorsed the individual interpretation 

**Why Americans started to arm themselves so enthusiastically ?** 

**⇒ Pamela HAAG, *The Gunning of America. Business and the making of American gun culture*, 2016**
- The firearms industry is a **supply-driven** market (ads)
- In the **mid-1960s, the homicide rate increased spectacularly** ⇒ the gun industry pushed the message that the only way for Americans to be safe was to defend themselves ! 
- The « **only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good buy with a gun** » (NRA = *National Riffle Association*) ⇒ 70% of gun owners claim to have one for protection 

**Guns owners were disproportionately white but more & more blacks buy guns today** (Black Gun Owners Association) in context of BLM (police does not protect African Americans).

But **self-defence is a minuscule part of gun deaths**. 

⚠ And **no correlation between the homicide rate and the growth of guns**. 

The reality, **the more guns you buy to defend you family the more likely you are to kill your wife and your children**… 

Suicide with guns has a bigger lethal rate than other way of self-harm. The decision of suicide is taking in impulse (facilitated when you own a gun). Also, it is easier to kill someone with a gun. 

There is **limited room for tightening firearm laws**. **Enormously politicised issue**. 

They are **loophole about background checks** : 
- Gun faire (no checks) v. Brick and Mortar shop
- Second-hand market 

**Background checks is a common demand of public opinion but Republican politicians voted against Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019** ⇒ responding to **lobbies** (but not through financial power, few millions only). 

Recently, the NRA’s leader Wayne LaPIERRE is being sued because he spent NRA’s money on personal holidays ! 

**People passionate about weapons** (the **10% of owners owning 40% of guns**) **are mobilised during elections** (Rep fear of antagonising their electorate). 

> Guns don’t kill people. People kill people. – Another NRA’s slogan 

**Individual responsibility** v. t

The **Centre for Disease Control (CDC)** describing a **gun deaths epidemic**. But **individual responsibility** approach is more compatible with gun owners’ mentality ⇒ better chance of success. For instance, compulsory training sessions could limit the risk of gun deaths.
