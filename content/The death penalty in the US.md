# The death penalty in the US
***
It concerns **fewer and fewer people** (≈300/year in 1970s-1990s but only 20 in 2022)

**1988** : **Kenneth SMITH** paid by a preacher to kill his wife to get life insurance. 

**2022** : 1st attempt to execution SMITH (long death row) but failed. So it was decided to gas him with nitrogen (untested method). 

**Jan 2024** : 1st use of **pure nitrogen** to execute Mr SMITH (he killed someone in 1988), ⇒ denounced by UN & UE (because long agony). 

The <b>8<sup>th</sup></b> **amendment** banned torture and cruel punishments ⇒ could be used to denounce the method as unconstitutional 

Depends on geography ! **Legislators are not sure what to do** with the death penalty. **Reluctance to use but hesitation to abolish it formally**. 

Most executions in the **South** (and especially **Texas**). 

A lot of **executions are conducted unprofessionally** (they are botched). 

**Method mostly used = lethal injection** (cocktail of 3 drugs). But rare drugs produced by European laboratories.

**2011** : the **EU imposed a ban on exporting the drugs** ⇒ US ran out of drugs & US’s laboratories don’t want to produce them (brand-issue). 

Since, **untested methods** ⇒ easier to challenge the decision in court (with the 8th amendment). But why these methods ? They are easier ways to quickly execute someone (gun, guillotine). Because **Americans don’t want the death penalty to appear brutal**. Lethal injection appears as a **medical procedure** ⇒ why **lot of death sentences but less important number of executions**. 

Yes, **the US are an outlier in the Western world** but if you like at public opinion, **America’s public opinion in favour is not so different from public opinion in others western countries** like FR or UK. Americans are not always more blood thirsty ! **1847** : complete ban in Michigan. 

**Why public opinion in favour is decreasing ?** Cruel methods yes but also **fear of miscarriage of justice**. 

Also **racial bias in the use of death penalty**. Enormous over-representation of African Americans (but not racist if blacks are more criminal). Nevertheless, **killing black peoples is less likely to result in death penalty than killing whites**. So real racist bias (same problem with prison sentences). 

The death penalty **does not act as a deterrent**.
