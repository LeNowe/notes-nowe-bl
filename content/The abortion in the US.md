# The abortion in the US
***
- Huge debate in the US between pro-choice/pro-life movements = feminism v. evangelicals 
- **1973** : **ROE v. WADE ruling** = legal-right to abortion → repealed in **2022** 
- Cf. [[Texte 25 - Jerry Falwell, Listen America ( 1980 )]] 
- Abortion is at the chore of the question of **individual autonomy** 
- Evangelicalism = direct relation to God ( ⇒ light on theology and strong on feelings ! )

## News : states’ referendum

- Recently, ∃ **wave of states’ referendum** to add abortion to state constitution <u>Ex</u> : 56% « yes » in Ohio where TRUMP had 53% of the vote in 2020 ⇒ Ohio is clearly a **swing-state**. 
- **The number of people wanting to protect abortion is bigger than the Democrat electorate** 
- But also anti-abortion amendment in conservative states ( but again same phenomenon )

## Abortion’s history

- **1900** : abortion = criminalised in every state but the federal Constitution said nothing 
- **1960s** : some states make abortion legal 
- **1970** : Hawaii = first state to legalise abortion on demand 
- **1973** : The SP ruled on the ROE v. WADE case ( = lady from Texas wanting an abortion = personal choice and not medical ). It ruled that **states cannot ban on-demand abortion**. They used the « **right to privacy** » in the Constitution 

BUT **federalisation of the issue** ⇏ end of state autonomy 
- 1st term = no restrictions
- 2st term = conditional access to abortion 
- 3st term = possibility of bans unless risk of ✞

**What sort of conditions could be imposed ?** 
- **1992 : Planned Parenthood v. Casey** = as long as ban ≠ « **undue burden** » for women 
- But extremely vague expression ⇒ significant restrictions 

From **2016-2020** TRUMP named 3 SC justices ( = enormous ) and he selected conservative justices hostile to abortion ⇒ **2022** : **DOBBS v. JACKSON ruling** in which the SC overturned ROE v. WADE. 

Some states had passed **trigger laws** ⇒ legislation automatically changed in some states. A **madly heterogeneous situation now**. 

## Law, clinics and social classes 

- Nb of abortions = max in 1990s then decline. 
- The poorer you are the more you have a chance to abort 
- 60% are in their 20s 
- Difficulty to access and few clinics ⇒ waiting line ⇒ risk of being too late
- Abortion is costly = medical cost, travel cost, days off 
- If you have the $ and go in other state ⇒ the State considers you as a murderer , will they sue you ? 
- BUT 50% of cases abortion is triggering by taking a pill ⇒ you can order the pill by post ⇒ some states have tried to ban ⇒ SC said no for now ( but ↗ risk with pill )

## Political debates 

<b>⇒ Historically from the 19<sup>th</sup> to 1960s the Democrats were the one against abortion</b> 
- They were the dominant party in the South ( rural, conservative ). 
- **1920s-60s** : Democrats → party of minorities ( Italians, Irish = Catholics  )

**⇒ But ≈ 1970s-80s DP party of the poor & minorities → party of the educated**
- **1992** : « **Abortion should be safe, legal and rare** » BILL CLINTON = indicative of the transition 

**1976** : The « **Hyde amendment** » but ⚠ it is not an amendment but a law passed by Congress saying that there could be **no federal funding** for abortion ( unless life of mother is at risk ). Supported by Democrats like BIDEN. But when he campaigned in 2019 he changed his stance.  Symmetrically, if you want to run for office as a Republican you have to declare that you are « Pro life ». 

But there is a **disconnection between very polarised parties’ stance and the stance of an average american** ( more moderate ). The obvious compromise seems to be legalisation during the first three months of pregnancy and ban during the last months. But that compromise cannot be delivered because of political polarisation… 

Now, « pro-life » wants a federal ban. But it is unlikely to happen. **The DOBBS ruling has threatened so much abortion, let’s calm down** ⇒ « pro-choice » victories. <u>Ex</u> : TRUMP called six-week bans « terrible » in Florida ≈ very closed to a total ban. He understood that hard legislation is not so much popular among the population ⇒ hostility to abortion might cease to be on the Republican’s agenda. But Mike JOHNSON’s accession as speaker suggest that conservative Christians views remain central. So maybe, maybe not. 

**⇒ The Alabama Supreme Court has ruled that frozen embryos = children (in november 2024)**
- About IVF (*in vitro* fertilisation) = difficult issue to handle if you are a Republican (in favour of families but it entails that some embryos will be unused ⇒ ≈ IVF illegal)

**⇒ The Supreme Court hears its first abortion case since ending Roe**
- Abortion pills = constitutional ? 
- Update : they said yes
