# Texte 3 - Robert Walpole, speech given to the House of Commons ( 13 February 1741 )

## Introduction

The beginning of the Hanoverian dynasty in 1714 – when George I, a German distant heir of James I ascended the throne – led to a series of reigns of disinterested king and queens that enabled the emergence of the notion of Prime minister.

George Ist : 1714 - 1727
George II : 1724 - 1760
George III : 1760 - 1820 
⇒ Whig domination from 1714-1760 
⇒ Walpole P.M from 1721-1740

During a long period of Whig domination in Parliament ( 1714 - 1760 ) the notion of Prime minister gradually emerged to criticise the power and influence of an MP : Robert Walpole.

Walpole : first prime minister in British history
This notion gradually emerge.
At the beginnin, P.M was an insult of R.W opposants 

**1701-1741** : R.W at the parliament 
⇒ He remained P.M for about 20 years ( 1720s-1730s )

We are the beginnin of the Hannover dynasty :
- end of Stuarts
- **1714** : George I became king of Great Britain but he did’nt speak english and was not particulary interest in Britain and government affairs. ⇒ He left a lot of leeway to the ministers.
- The notion of **cabinet** emerged between the ministers ⇒ Robert Walpole became increasingly important and powerful ( he was in very good terms with the crown ) ⇒ he was called in a critical way the « prime minister »
- Walpole increased his influence by using Royal Patronage ( grant honors and position by the king ). Walpole influenced the king to advice him to give honors to people who where loyal to him. Thus, he had a huge network of influence. He gained power in the cabinet but was suspected of manipulating the king. 

The political system at that time was tightly locked ( the Whigs were in power for a long period ). Parliament was rigged. The vote was census based.
Hannaoverian kings did’nt trust the Tories cause they supported Stuart and Jacobites.

The country was divided by counties and boroughs ( constituencies that elected 2 MPs ; division from the M.A )
- Boroughs :
- Counties :
⇒ distorsion at that time ( representation of population )

**Conversly** : inversement 

Pocket boroughswith few landowners example  : Old Sarum ( two voters electing two MPs )

A lot of bribery ( lords could control the number of seat in the HOC ) ⇒ Rotten boroughs The Duke of Newcastle controled 7 constituencies 

To reduce the cost of bribery, Tories and Whigs agreed on the repartition of constituencies.

**1716** : Septennial Act passed by Whigs ( election 7 years ) ⇒ cheaper and possibility to strenghten their influence 
⇒ Whigs dominance 

Walpole was the son of a Whig MP, he went to public to public school ( Cambridge ). He left university to manage the family estate. Was elected MP at the age of 35. Remained MP for 40 years.
1708 : became secretary of war ⇒ treasurer for the Navy ⇒ became PM in 1721 ( he helded for himself several positions in the government : first lord of the treasury, minister of the king in the HOC  )

### Context of the speech 

Walpole wanted to preserving peace ( could bring trade and britain prosperity )
Except at that time was occuring the Austrian War of Succession. Throne supposed to go to maria theresa but Fred II of Prussia wanted throne too.
Public opinion in britain was in favor of the War to defend Maria Theresa…
Walpole’s opponents tried to gain his fall ⇒ Walpole defended himself in a speech : our document.

### Text 

Defensive speech : 
But avoid accusations by using rhetorical questions 
Trying to legitimate his decisions 
Turning personnal accusations into accusations against the crown and the constitution 
Presenting himself as a victim 
Me V.S them 

#### First paragraph 

« forty years » : passing remark and fake humility ⇒ how dare you attack me ? i’m above you 
legal vocabulary : aspect of a trial rather than a political debate 
self-centered : level of honor and feelings than rationnal ⇒ strategy of victimisation 

#### Second paragraph 

« styled me » « chimerical authority » : the claimed influence of Walpole is the mind of MP’s
« influence » « liberality » « reward » ⇒ The Royal Patronage 
« tyranny » ⇒ reference to the R° and to the behavior of James II. If you accuse Walpole of being a tyrant you accuse the king to be tyrant 

#### Third paragraph 

« destruction of liberty » « slavery » ⇒ parallel wth the R° 
« encroachments » ⇒ the king go beyond his powers to interfere Parliament’s business
ref. to the Stuart Kings 

#### Fourth paragraph 

rhetorical questions 
« white staff etc » ⇒ he refused to sit in HOL cause he had more influence in the Commons 
humility but in fact practical reasons 
the order of the Garter : highest order of Chivalry ( around 25 ) ⇒ ahead of the Dukes 
fake humility that helps him to show off 

#### Fifth paragraph

Response to nepotism accusation 
It doesn’t refute the fact but the reasons behind 
he keeps repeting how he benefits for the country 

#### Last paragraph 

he reverses the accusation of encroachment 
he keeps reversing of his accusations
