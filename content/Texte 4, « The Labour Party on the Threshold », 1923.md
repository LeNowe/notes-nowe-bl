# Sidney Webb, « The Labour Party on the Threshold », 1923
***
The text exposes what can be defined as « **british socialism** » = 20% Marx + 60% Bilbo the Hobbit + 20% Jesus Christ 

Labour : 
- Not revolutionary but **gradualism** 
- **Parliamentary** ⇒ obtain the power thanks to an electoral majority 

This moderation is : 
- **Tactical** : the Party had never been in power and had to appear not dangerous. **1924** : Zinoniev letter ⇒ electors are still suspicious. 
- Also **sincere** : **socialist aims but with british means** !  You have to adapt socialism to the specificity of the electorate ! Socialism ≠ universal model. Moderation protects democracy (not so far from BURKE !). 

**⇒ The Fabian Society**
- **1884** : Founded (after the third **Reform Act of 1884** = rest of the urban working class and the rural working class) ⇒ among them <u>Ex</u> : V. WOOLF 
- Gradualist intellectuals ⇒ sort of think-tank 
- « Fabian » = ref to **Fabius Cunctator** = roman general famous for being prudent and for winning through a lot of little battles ⇒ **gradualism**

**1918** : The **Labour Party Constitution** wrote by Sidney WEBB (so Fabians are close enough to the center of gravity of the Labour Party even if they are moderate). 
- **Clause IV** = the **party aims to nationalise the means of production** but it should happen by democratic/parliamentary/peaceful means (same destination nevertheless !)

The LP has to focus on **praticable changes**. 

**Two versions of socialism** : 
- **Utopian socialism** : not based on historical determinism but on showing the world a utopia 
- **Marxist socialism** : socialism = inevitable consequence of history ⇒ determinism 

According to WEBB, **socialist changes had already begun** : 
- **Local scale ⇒ « gas and water socialism »** = municipal socialism = municipalisation of the « utilities » (energy, water, communications) <u>Ex</u> : J. CHAMBERLAIN in the late 19<sup>th</sup> Birmingham to regulate natural monopoly (economy of scale). 
- **National scale** : 
	- **1908** : Old Age Pensions (= pensions founded by general taxation)
	- **1909** : The People’s Budget 
	- **1911** : National Insurance (= remained individual system of insurance)
	- ↗ state intervention during the Great War 

**Institutional conservatism**. WEBB accept institutions as they are. 

- **1893** : Creation of the Independent Labour Party (Keir HARDIE, former Scottish miner + unionist)
- **1900** : The Labour Representation Committee 
- **1906** : Labour Party

Several dates = **gradual process** (independent groups aggregated gradually) **pushed by**  : 
- **Trade unions** (++)
- **Intellectuals** (+)
- **Marxism** (+–)

**1906** : « Liberal landslide » → **1922** : LB > Lib Party 

**Why the Liberal party lost so much influence ? ⇒ the effect of the war** 
- Before WWI : Liberal = party of reform, distinct identity 
- **1916** : The Lib party split between Herbert ASQUITH and Lloyd GEORGE (close to the Conservative)
- **1918** : « **Coalition Liberal** » = Liberals wanting to govern in a Coalition with the Conservatives 

So WEBB knew that the LP was close to power ⇒ **it has to show that it was party of government = a government-in-waiting** (and not a simply militant opposition). This **responsibilisation of the party is not a betrayal** according to WEBB. 
- **1923-1924** : Labour led a minority government, did nothing = success because it showed that they were not dangerous 

**1895** : Sidney + Beatrice WEBB ⇒ created the London School of Economics. Beatrice worked for the sociologist Charles BOOTH. 

The most sacred value = **individual liberty**. It can threatened by the free market (« the anarchy of competition ») but also by « governmental tyranny » ⇒ **government intervention = lesser evil**. **Class struggle is seen as a problem** ! A good government = cooperation of citizens ≠ dictatorship of the proletariat.  Centralisation of the power should be limited as much as possible = prioritisation of democratic principles + empowering the cooperative movement. 

**1844** : Creation of Cooperative Movement in Lancashire (textile industry)

Finally, **emphasis on the spirit of socialism** ⇒ Labour as a **religion/moral project = christian socialism** : 
- Keir HARDIE → a preacher (when he was not a miner)

**⇒ British socialism** : 
- Reformist 
- Pragmatic
- Adapting socialism to british society
- Hesitation between : 
	- Technocratic futurism (technology ⇒ monopoly = bad from a democratic point of view ⇒ need of state intervention to control the economy)
	- William Morris 

**⇒ Robert OWEN (1771-1858)**
- Presented as the **1st English socialist** 
- Married the daughter of a factory owner in **New Lanark** (Scotland)
- He thought that **exploiting workers was counterproductive** = **paternalistic approach** 
- Thought that people’s behavior = result of the environment 
- Transformed New Lanark = paternalistic environment ⇒ **improving working and living conditions** (health, schools, etc.) = short working hours, company cottages, parks and **thought that by demonstrating the ideal situation other employers will follow = utopian socialism** !
- But others employers did not believe in the New Lanark’s model 
- He read RICARDO (labour-derived value + capitalists and landowners are living on rents only) ⇒ founded the **cooperative movement** 
- **1824** : Created a **utopian community** based on egalitarian principles ⇒ went in the US in Indiana = **New Harmony** = failure within 2 years 
- **1834** : Went back to UK thinking something else was needed = **powerful trade unions** ⇒ created the Grand National Consolidated Trade Union (GNCTU) = whole of the working class in one large union. It collapsed partly because of government repression and partly because of splitting interests among unionists. 
- To sum up :
	- **The industrial revolution ⇒ ↗ inequalities** 
	- **Need to redirect the industrial revolution in favour of cooperative ≠ capitalists** 
	- **But not against the industrial revolution in itself !** 
	- **But appeared moderate to some of its contemporaries (kept some paternalistic attitude)** <u>Ex</u> : in 1832 he was not in favour of the extension of the franchise to the working class, he believed the working class was not educated enough and that enfranchising them would entail social war = obstacle to progress (has to be started by the top of society). 

**⇒ William MORRIS (1834-96)**
- **Interior decorator** and a socialist thinker 
- Came from the **upper class** (daddy had shares in copper mines ⇒ never had to work)
- **Aesthetic dissatisfaction** with the goods made the industrial system ⇒ decided to product beautiful goods (≠ not standardised ⇒ the worker can be creative) 
- Created a company producing a lot of things (mainly furniture) = sort of **neo-medieval counter-culture** (thought that the public would acknowledge the superiority of his goods ⇒ change production methods) ⇒ **enormous costs** ! Realised that only the rich were buying his goods and that his neo-medieval culture would remain consumed by a minority + hypocritical model
- So he hanged out with Marxist groups (but did not agreed with all Marxist ideas)
- **1890** : *News from nowhere* = fiction describing a perfect Britain = medieval Britain (the character is dreaming during a Marxist meeting) 

<b>Two thesis explaining why 20<sup>th</sup> English socialism is a moderate socialism ?</b>
- English socialism was founded by R. OWEN and W. MORRIS ⇒ not suprising if English socialism is a moderate socialism 
- English socialist in the 20<sup>th</sup> were moderate and in order to underline their moderation they lay emphasis on OWEN’s and MORRIS’s work
