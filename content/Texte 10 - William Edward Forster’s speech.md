## Introduction 

School only for aristocracy 
private tutors
public schools ( actually private , Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester )  big campus with a medieval architecture , boarding schools , for boys only 
Train the elite of tomorrow 

From the middle upper classes 
Grammar schools ( you have to pay ) 
today most prestigious school inside the state system 

end of the XVIII
Sunday school reserved for working classes , free of charge 
Only textbook = Bible 
provide a basic form of education for working class children 
teachers were laymen and not churchmen 
extended rapidly 
1830 : 1.2 million children 

1833 : First Factory Act paved the way of factory schools 
henry Braugham’s Bills for primary school were defeated 

1840s : new type of schools ⇒ Ragged Schools
created by philanthropist in deprived areas 

Voluntary schools created by the different churches of England 
National Society Anglicans 
British 

Different types of primary ( reading, writing, basic calculus ) schools , different teachers, methods : heterogeneous institution 
They were all referred to as Voluntary schools 

Forster Education Act : creation of a proper primary school in England 
But did not abolish the existing schools and change primary education
Created new schools were they were non 
Not to enter in competition wth religious organisation but to adapt to the existing schools ( to have the support of churches and pass the Bill in Parliament )
Compulsory primary education 

System’s structure remained until 1944’s Butler Act that created 3 types of schools : 
- Grammar schools ( elite )
- Secondary modern Schools or Secondary Moderns
- Technical Schools 

Exam : the Eleven Plus determine your future 

1960s - 2000s

1950-1960s : the left criticise this system
1966 : And replaced it with Comprehensive schools ⇒ non-selective system, catchment area 

But Grammar schools managed to survive ( lobbying )

Huge discrepancies between the two types 

CS criticised of driving the people’s down 
Wanted to reform 
⇒ more autonomy to state schools 
⇒ new type of schools : academies ( under Blair’s government : more autonomy to schools in expectation of better results ) and free schools ( under Cameron’s gvt : full autonomy, own curriculum, hire whoever they want. The gov. looks at the performances, not only catchment area  )
But they were still comprehensive schools 
System based on competition btw schools ( neoliberal system ) 

**All children in England between the ages of 5 and 16 are entitled to a free place at a state school**. All state schools receive funding through their local authority or directly from the government.

Today dominent type = free schools 

## Issue at stake

To what extent is this text is a compromise between the radical point of view that want to create a new educationnal system from scrach and the conservative point that wanted the existing religious organisation ? 

## Outline 

1. A creation of an universal state managed school system 
2. It does not make a clean sweep of the existing school 
3. But it still asserts the prevalence of the text 

Conclusion : beginning of a universal primary school system 
⇒ Butler Act
