# Texte 1 - Thomas Jefferson, *Notes on the State of Virginia*, 1785
***
## Introduction 

Text written in **1781** at the **end of the War of independence**. A french diplomat sent a list of questions to the Continental Congress to collect information about the American states. JEFFERSON is writing for a **European public** Virginia’s answer. He decided that it should also be published in book form. 

Virginia had a special place at the time ( where a large number of the political class came from ). He’s **introducing a new nation**, the United States. Encyclopedic style. 

**1781** : The siege of Yorktown. End of fights. 

**1783** : Treaty of Paris. Official end of the war of independence. 

The future of **America’s political future was unclear**. Because when independence was declared what replaced the 13 colonies was **13 independent states**. They unilaterally sever the link with Britain. The forces were unequal : 1st military power v. 13 unorganised states. Their only chance was to cooperate. But they did not feel confortable : if we create a new central power it will recreate a tyrannical power ruling the former colonies. 

Back in the 1780s people in American identified themselves as their state and not as an American. **Laborious creation of institutions**. 

**1773** : Boston Tea Party ⇒ British Parliament passed the Coercitive Acts *a.k.a* the Intolerable Acts
- Closure of the port of Boston. 
- Trials in Britain. 
- Unilateral suspension of Massachusetts charter that regulated its political organisations. 

The **charters** devolved and defined local-decisions making. It was a **devolution of power** ≠**federalism**. ⚠ 
- **Devolution** = the local powers are still owned by the central power. **Power is lent to the local level not given**. It implies that it perfectly legal to take back the power. 
- **Federalism = two juridictions** : some powers belong to the local government. 

In U.K today somethings belongs by the central government of U.K. But there is also a Parliament in Scotland. <u>Ex</u> : Scottish students can go for free to the university. But, it is devolution !!  

⚠ The difference is intellectual. Practically it is sometimes difficult for political reasons to take back certain powers. 

But **the powers that was lent for so long started to feel owned**. The suspension of Massachusetts charter recalled that they were colonial subjects and that their powers was devolved ! ⇒ Others states felt concerned and decided that the Americans colonies should coordinate. 

**1774** : The First Continental Congress to protest collectively. But there was not a universal consensus. Some colonies stayed loyal to Britain. Not revolutionary yet. 
- Boycotting U.K imports 
- Petition to King George III ( accepting the authority of the king in a way… )

**19 April 1775** : Battles of Lexington & Concord. Some american rebels starting a guerrilla operation. 

**1775** : Creation of the Second Continental Congress. More radical than the first. It had delegates from all colonies to organise the fight against Britain. Military resistance and radicalisation but to get concessions. But not everybody thought to obtain independence. 

But its institutional legitimacy was unclear and disputable. It needed to be replaced with a more constituted power. 

**1777** : The Articles of Confederation were **drafted**. Created a **military alliance** between the 13 states. They agree to assist each other in case of military agression. Created the Congress of Confederation. But any decisions could be vetoed by any of the 13 states. But it did **not have the power to raise taxes**. It had to beg the states for money and they frequently said no. **Lack of solidarity**. 

**1777-1778** : The Winter at Valley Forge. The states refused to give money to the army. Soldiers nearly starved to death. They preferred risking losing the war before losing their sover

**1781** : The Articles of Confederation were **ratified**. 

In was a **time of huge political imagination**. JEFFERSON knew he was introducing America to the European public. Why him ? He was one of America’s central intellectual figure ( Enlightenment ) and had theorised what American democracy should like = **the Jeffersonian democracy** is a « **democracy of yeomen farmers** ».  

The yeomen are **economically independent**. It allows **social and political equality**. Ideal of self-sufficiency and an egalitarian Republic. 

But JEFFERSON was not a yeomen farmer but a planter who owns slaves… Virginia depended to a huge extent on the exploitation of slaves ≈ 40% of the population. He is emblematic of **America’s tension between progressive philosophical ideas and social realities depending on the system of slavery**. 

## <u>I. The moral scandal of slavery</u> 

- **Self-indictment** as a slave owner and as a statesman tolerated slavery. 
- **Morality v. path dependency**. Slavery had became so central that you couldn't simply abolish it. 
- **Social centrality of slavery**. Everything of the social habits of Virginia seems to depend on slavery.

### A ) The humanity of slaves 

- **Nurture v. nature** ( l.9 ) and the human as « imitative animal ». Empiricist idea = man is a blank slate ⇒ their **inferiority was created by the institutions**. ( l. 21 ). 
- **Total equality** : slaves must be citizens ( l. 17 ). 

### B ) Absolute domination 

- Lexical field of **radical opposition** : superlatives, « master » and « slave ». <u>Ex</u> : « the most unremitting despotism ». 
- **Passions and violence** : in a slave society men are governed by dangerous emotions. Perhaps reference to the sexual exploitation of slaves ( he was involved in it ). According to his ennemies he had children with « **Black Sal** », one of his slaves. 

### C ) An immoral institution

- All **slave owners are corrupted by the institution**. It creates evil people. There are not good and bad slave owners. 
- God should be on the slaves’ side and a nationwide slave rebellion might take place. 

## <u>II. A betrayal of US values</u> 

### A ) The perversion of America’s social ideal

- Two groups with separate rights 
- No social mobility 

### B ) The alienation of inalienable rights 

- « these liberties » = « gift of God » cf. god-given **inalienable** rights including life, liberty, pursuit of happiness ( cf. *Declaration of independence* and Locke v. Hobbes ). 
- But supporting slavery is the negation of all these principles, it cancels the *Declaration of independence*. Slavery is damaging America’s main values creating a precedent to violate liberty. 

### C ) The destruction of Republican virtues 

- At the time republic was seen as an experiment but nothing sure… ( cf. Montesquieu : Republic = small because more common interests ⇒ the bigger the territory, the more authoritarian the government ). So it would work only if citizens displays democratic frugality. 
- But slavery creates despotes’ mentality among slaves owners not public-spirited citizens. This corrupted psychology is inherited and will contaminate the future. 

## <u>III. An inconclusive text</u> 

### A ) Impossible emancipation 

- Why Jefferson hopes for total emancipation but do not call for it ? 
- Relying on cotton & tobacco crops based on slavery 
- Conflict between the liberty of slaves and slaves owners’ right of property 

```ad-summary
title: Abolition of slavery in UK

- In U.K’s Empire slaves are in the West Indies ( = the Caribbean ) where they were producing sugar. In 1820s they were ≈ 700k. 
- WILBERFORCE ( = evangelical christian ) led a abolitionist movement ⇒ **1833** : Act of Parliament abolishing slavery. 
- It costed £ 20m of compensations ( = 40% of State’s budget ⇒ borrowed and ended paying in 2015 ). It was phased out over 7 years. Still allowed in territories controlled by the East Indian Company until 1843. 
```

- To many slaves to compensate the economic loss and.
- Send them far away from their former masters to avoid revenge. But to many slaves to evacuating them.
- ⚠ **Society with slaves** ( = North ) ≠ **Slave society** ( = South, slavery is the central aspect ⇒ enormous inequalities between rich whites and poor whites compensated by the feeling of being on the good side ⇒ abolition = social threat ). 
- First drafts of the *Declaration of Independence* blamed U.K for « introducing slavery » 

### B ) Jefferson’s perspective on race relations 

- He’s not a racist but is more interested on harm caused on whites than on blacks suffering. 
- Also he’s incapable of imagining a society where whites and blacks could cohabit. 
- It nos biology, it is path dependency but the result is the same : necessity of whites’ domination on blacks. 

### C ) An avoidance strategy 

- Surprising first lines considering catholic point of view but also particular point of view. 
- He only assumes that the problems will solve itself with the progress of the revolution. 
- And there is a grain of truth in this statement ⇒ **1777** : Vermont abolished slavery ( 1st state ! ). 
- But it still is wishful thinking. Vermont and Northern States had few slaves in their territory. 

## Conclusion

- An hesitating denunciation without a clear call for abolition = very common among politicians
- Attitude reflected in **1787**’s constitution with the <b>⅗<sup>th</sup> Compromise</b> = result of political calculation to keep the balance between North and South ⇒ ambiguity on the status of slave = are they just property or human ? 
- In the Constitution no explicit references to « slaves » and « slavery ». Same in the <b>⅗<sup>th</sup> Compromise</b> where slaves are « no whites nor Indians ». 
- The Constitution stated that the importation of slaves from abroad cannot be banned before **1808**. The South calculated that it would let enough time to import enough slaves. Moral consideration of the North and South’s interest taking into account.
