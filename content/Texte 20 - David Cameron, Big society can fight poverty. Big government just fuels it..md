# Texte 20 - David Cameron, « Big society can fight poverty. Big government just fuels it. »
***
## Introduction 

2010 general elections : hung parliament 
⇒ Minority government ? No.
⇒ Coalition gov. Lib.Dem + Labour. Appeared undemocratic.
⇒ Coalition gov. C. + Lib.Dem.

They wrote a coalition agreement. 
D. Cameron = P.M 
Nick Clegg = deputy P.M ù

## Analysis 

rephrasing of a small gov. approach more socially oriented 
echo of the *Great society* 
middle way between Neoliberal stance of Thatcherism and the New Labour 
Anti-Thatcher stance Renewing of **One nation conservatism** 
Labour caused atomisation 
Obj : occupy the centrist space by rejecting the Labour to a leftist appearance. & get back the working class vote 
Notion of equal opportunities 
Social conservatism inherited from the Victorian area 

pragmatism v.s ideology 
In between Thatcher and Labour : state as a catalyst
