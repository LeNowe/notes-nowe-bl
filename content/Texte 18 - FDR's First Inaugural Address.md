- Extended the powers to the President in terms of regulation of the banking system. 
- Determined conditions on which banks could reopen after the four-day bank holiday decided by the President. 
- The Federal Reserve Bank could issue currency for banks in difficulty and could limit the operations of a bank if it did not have sufficient assets. 

**1933: National Recovery Administration** 
- Created under the National Industry Recovery Act of 1933. 
- Declared unconstitutional in 1935. 
- Suspension of antitrust laws for two years. 
- Definition of a new regulatory system - companies are encouraged to design codes of fair competition and fair labour practices. Minimum prices. Restrictions on production. 

**1933: Agricultural Adjustment Act and Administration** 
- Introduction of the principle of “parity” - raising basic farm prices until they were in balance with the general economy. Eliminating surpluses by banning production from a part of agricultural surfaces (to reduce acreage) and by encouraging (with benefits) farmers to produce only what is needed for domestic consumption. 
- Negotiating agreements with meat producers and dairy companies to regulate markets and fix prices. 
- Measures financed by a tax on the food industry. 
- Parity reached in 1935. 
- 1936: struck down by the Supreme Court 
- 1938: another Act was passed by Congress, with an emphasis on soil conservation. 

**1933: Public Works Administration** 
- Created by the National Industrial Recovery Act. 
- Provides for the construction of public works like dams, bridges, hospitals, schools. 
- Headed by Secretary of Interior HAROLD L. ICKES. 

**1933: Tennessee Valley Authority** 
- Purpose: to revitalise one of America’s poorest regions (7 States) by building dams (to prevent floods and limit soil erosion and to supply cheap electricity) and producing fertilisers. 
- Ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1936. 

1933: Federal Emergency Relief Administration 
Replaced in 1935 by the WPA. 
Gives subsidies to the States to provide relief programs and create unskilled jobs in local and state governments. 

1933: Civilian Conservation Corps 
Purpose: to fight against massive unemployment among the youth. 
Operated through existing federal departments. 
Young men aged 18 to 25 on public relief are enrolled for 6 months to 2 years in unskilled jobs for conservation and protection of natural resources. 
Operated until 1942. 

**1935: Social Security Act** 
- At the origin, a wide, all encompassing plan composed of : 
	- an unemployment compensation scheme
	- an old-age pension scheme 
	- a health insurance scheme 
- But the health insurance plan was removed due to the opposition of the medical profession. 
- The plan was based on the principle of insurance, with an additional public assistance scheme (aid to dependent children). 

**1935: National Labor Relations Act = the Wagner Act ( drafted by Senator ROBERT WAGNER of New York )**
Principles: democracy in industry just as in Government, participation of workers through collective organisations + collective bargaining (= wage negotiations)
Unions and collective bargaining are recognized as a right and encouraged and protected by the Federal government. 
Employer interference or coercion are banned. 
Employers are required to bargain collectively with their employees’ representatives. 
Creation of the National Labor Relations Board to enforce the Act. 

**1935: Works Progress Administration (WPA)**
Headed by LARRY HOPKINS
Federally-funded employment for the jobless - building and road construction, maintenance of parks, research at the Library of Congress, blue-collar and white-collar jobs
Fierce opposition of the conservatives
Increasingly used for defense work after 1941
Abolished in 1943

**1938: Fair Labor Standards Act**
- Creates a minimum wage. 
- Bans the employment of under-age workers. 
- Payment of extra hours at the rate of 150%. 

**1936: landslide victory** 

**1937: the Court Packing scandal** 
- In order to overcome the opposition of the Supreme Court, which had ruled against several of his plans, ROOSEVELT tried to pass a Judicial Procedures Reform Bill, which would have allowed him to appoint one new Justice for every Justice over the age of 70. 
- In practice, that would have enabled him to change the majority in the Court. But the project was faced with bi-partisan opposition and it failed. Perceived as contrary to the check and balances system. 

**1940** : broke away with the tradition established by WASHINGTON and sought and won a third term. 
**1941** : Pearl Harbor
**1944** : re-elected for a 4th term
He died in April 1945, a few weeks after his inauguration. Was succeeded by TRUMAN, his VP. 

ROOSEVELT managed to draw a **coalition** composed of: 
- labor unions
- blue collar workers
- minorities
- farmers
- white southerners
- intellectuals
- the banking and oil industry 
- unemployed workers and poor people

ROOSEVELT contributed to re-defining the Democratic Party as the **champion of the poor, the middle class, unions and minorities.** 

He also **redefined the notion of liberalism**. So far, liberalism meant freedom from government intervention. ROOSEVELT ceaselessly used the term to mean government intervention to protect the citizens, especially in terms of jobs and income, without which freedom doesn’t exist. 
So he transformed the relationship between the Federal government and the people. Its involvement in the social and economic life of the country was no longer to be perceived as a form of oppression but as a form of protection. 

ROOSEVELT appointed the **first woman Cabinet member** - FRANCES PERKINS, Secretary of Labor. And he drew a number of his advisers and top administrators from minority groups ( Jews, Catholics, African-Americans ).

- Presenting himself as a saviour 
- Asserting the prominence of Presidency over Congress and giving a certain interpretation of constitution 
- Populist stance 
- Apocalyptic description 
- Denouncing the « laisser faire » outworn tradition 
- Jacksonian aspect : democratic justification of an increase of executive power 
- Protecting the humble and the common people 
- Jeffersonian view praising a balance between agriculture and industry

I )  Answering an economic crisis by praising action and denouncing the outworn tradition of « laisser faire »
II ) Asserting the prominence of executive power on Congress 
I ) A Populist stance 

Issue at stake : how does FRD uses the Jacksonian stance in order to appear as the saviour of the country in this time of crisis 

- **I ) The assertion of the necessity of government intervention through the reinforcement of presidential authority** 
- **II ) But also a speech praising religious and moral values to appeal to a conservative electorate** 
- **III ) A populist stance**
