# Conservative manifesto, 1979
***
**Extremely vague text** ! Surprising for a manifesto, we don’t get many details… Why ? 
- Just let Labour lose (it makes sense but difficult to find elements in the text)
- Lack of consensus among Conservatives 
- Rupture in principles (rather than on economics)
- Thatcherism did not quite exist yet 

## <u>I. Long term economic difficulties that Britain was faced with</u>

- Election manifesto for a election fought from the **opposition** (v. CALLAGHAN’s gov)
- **1978-1979 : « Winter of discontent »**
- Motion of non-confidence after the **failure of the Scottish referendum** in favour of devolution 
- **The postwar consensus had collapsed** : **the Phillip’s curve was not working** (↗ inflation <u>and</u> unemployment = stagflation) = pillar of Butskellism 
- **Deficit of the balance of payments ⇒ need to make the exports competitive again ⇒ devaluation was likely ⇒ speculation against the pound** ⇒ CALLAGHAN went to the IMF to ask for cash and it did bailed out for Britain (not usual for a great power…) ⇒ **Britain = « Europe’s sick man »** ⇒ perception of national decline 
- **1976** : **CALLAGHAN (Labour) speech announcing a cut in public spending** (not saying he’s forced to do so but saying that Keynesian economics does not work anymore !) 

## <u>II. The claim that social and political order are at risk</u>

Society = « **on the brink of disintegration** » ⇒ not just an economic crisis but a moral crisis 

**⇒ 1978 = the « winter of discontent » (Shakespeare, *Richard III***)
- Wave of strikes caused by CALLAGHAN’s efforts to fight inflation ⇒ **refused to increase wages in the public sector** 
- **Rubbish** left uncollected 
- **Pickets** in hospitals 
- **Grave-diggers** refused to bury the dead = one isolated incident that struck public opinion 

**The crisis was instrumentalised by the Conservatives for election purposes** (*The Sun*). But public opinion was predisposed to be manipulated ! Because in the 1970s, lot of episodes of crisis. 

- **1970 : Edward HEATH’s (PM, Cons.) Seldon manifesto** ⇒ to some extent advocated for a rupture with the Postwar consensus (prioritising the fight against inflation, limiting state intervention in the economy. 
- **1972** : **Strike of the National Union of Miners**, HEATH thought « I mustn’t grant raises because I want to fight against inflation ». But coal was still important in British economy ⇒ economic disruptions… HEATH imposed a **3-day working week** ⇒ to save coal. But he had to accept miners’s revendications = **HEATH’s U-turn** 
- **1974** : The NUM went on strike again for more money ! HEATH said no, this time I’m going to win it ! He thought that he needed more legitimacy ⇒ **called an election on that question : « Who governs Britain ? »** (unions = Labour or government = Conservatives). But Conservatives lost seats (nevertheless Labour did not secure an absolute majority). 

## <u>III. The power of unions</u>

**⇒ Indeed, by 1979, unions benefited from a lot a legal protections** : 
- **Closed shop system** = legal 
- **No ballot before strikes** 
- **Strike pickets** = legal 
- **Secondary picketing** = legal 
- **Unions not liable for illegal strikes** 

Historically the Labour Party = created by the Unions. And **Unions provided a big share of the funding of the Labour Party ⇒ trade unions elected a large number of the members of the National Executive Committee (= leadership of Labour)**. 

**1969** : ***In place of Strife* (white paper) by Barbara CASTLE** (secretary of state for unemployment) ⇒ workers should vote before a strike. **Desire to limit the power of trades unions and make them more accountable for strikes**. But WILSON’s government did not implement legislation = too dangerous and too risky for the Party’s fund. 

During 1970s the working class ≠ collective force ⇒ **↗ wildcat strikes** (people wanting to advance their own situation, **no class consciousness**). **Lack of economic growth in Britain**. And Labour ideology ⇒ impossible higher growth (according to the tex). 

**↗ of the belief that private property > public ownership** + criticism of high taxation 

> No one would remember the Good Samaritan if he had only had good intentions. He had money too. – THATCHER 

**Labour has the wrong idea about the human nature** ⇒ individuals want to enrich themselves. People are not naturally collectivist. THATCHER ⇒↘ income taxe rate (compensated by × 2 of the VAT). **Shift back towards a conception of poverty inherited from the Victorian period** (« undeserving poor »). THATCHER used **piecemeal legislation** to destroy the rights of unions. THATCHER **always moralise the issue of inflation** (you give people the illusion that their purchasing power is increasing = **money illusion**…).  

**Relatively moderate platform** (by contrast with the cliché of Thatcherism) = desire to attract part of the working class electorate 
- **1970s** : **beginning of « de-alignment » (working class ⇏ Labour, middle-class ⇏ Conservative)** = **↘ correlation between class and vote** 
- **Thatcherism was not completely theorised** (first privatisations = small in term of net proceeds ⇒ experimental privatisations)
- Compromise between all the conservative schools within the party 

**1975 : THATCHER = leader ≠ the Party’s conversion to Thatcherism** : 
- The chose to get rid of HEATH ⇒ THATCHER
- Thatcherism ≠ theorised ⇒ she ≠ ideologue but a pragmatist <u>Ex</u> : when she was Minister of Education she continued **comprehensivisation**

**1944 : BUTLER Act ⇒ tripartite 2ndary education after the 11-plus**
- Grammar schools = latin + math (elite)
- Secondary modern = languages etc (children of the middle class)
- Technical schools (working class)

**1960s : governments (Lab + Cons) introduced comprehensivisation = to replace the system with one type of school *i.e* the comprehensive school** (⇒ ↗ social diversity ≈ collège unique)

**1980s : Cons (according to THATCHER) = the « wets » (moderate) + the « dries » (Thatcherism)**
- <u>Ex</u> : MACMILLAN about privatisation = « **selling off the family silver** »

**Michael HESELTINE** = ½ wet ½ dry = minister in THATCHER’s governments 
- **Toxteth riot** (= Liverpool, **1981**) ⇒ destroyed 
- HESELTINE thought that the state should help Liverpool to modernise = **urban regeneration**
