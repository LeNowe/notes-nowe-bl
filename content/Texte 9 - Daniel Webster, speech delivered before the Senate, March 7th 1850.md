# Texte 9 - Daniel Webster, speech delivered before the Senate, March 7th 1850
***
## Context 

**1787** : the Northwest Ordinance ⇒ created the Northwest territory where slavery was prohibited 
**1819** : the Missouri Compromise designed by Henry CLAY, « the great compromiser ».
**1850** : the Compromise of  1850 
- Slave trade abolished in Washington D.C 
- California = free state 
- Slavery allowed in Utah and New Mexico
fugitives laws

**Arguments to support slavery** : 
- Historical arguments : Greeks and Romans 
- Abraham had slaves and Jesus never spoke against slavery ; « mentioned » in the 10 Commandment 
- Southerners considered themselves as « descending » from the supporters of Charles the 1st during the 1st Revolution ( The Cavaliers ) Strong sense of superiority ( opposed to the North, « descending » from Cromwell « The roundheads »)
- Economic arguments : 
- Slavery was an humanitarian system 
- Constitutional arguments : ⅗ clause + Fugitive clause 

**The southern ideology : John CALHOUN** 
- John CALHOUN ( came from South California ) : Congress had not authority to exclude slavery in new territories. 
- He defended the expansion of slavery in *A Disquisition on Government*.
- The country was divided in « two factions » ( cf. Madison )
- No bad effect but preserving the country : for a law to be passed he had to be voted by the two factions *i.e* a « **concurrent majority** ».
- Two factions ⇒ two presidents 

**Abolitionist movement** 
- The words slave or slavery are not mentioned in the Constitution 
- Art. 1 section 9 « importation of persons is outlawed »
- Political arguments : the declaration of independence « all men … »
- Slavery created a state of fear and instability 
- Moral argument : slavery led to the moral corruption of the owner because no law limited his power on the slave.
- Economic : slavery was not profitable because slave work based on fear and entailed huge cost and prevented the modernisation of agriculture. 

**3 different trends of abolitionism** : 

- **The radical trend**
	- Newspaper = *The liberator* 
	- Head = William Lloyd GARRISON ( he burned the Constitution )
	- Slavery contrary to Christianity and the declaration of independence
	- Outright immediate abolition of slavery 
- **The moderate trend** 
	- Head = Theodor WELD ( a preacher who had published in **1839** *Slavery as it is* )
	- Gradualist stance ( to avoid economic disruption in the South and preserve peace )
- **The conciliatory trend** 
	- Head = Abraham LINCOLN 
	- Slavery had to be circumscribe to where it actually existed. 
	- Slavery = South’s « **peculiar institution** » judged unsustainable 

## Analysis 

A response to Calhoun’s ideas.
A text trying to avoid the issue of slavery 
A federalist point of view of citizenship 
Anti-Jacksonian point of view + a Whig point of view 
National vision V.S Factional vision
Elitist perception of power ( theory of the filter ) 
Notion of duty ( cf. Washington inaugural address ) 
References to Shakespeare and Elizabethan conception ( cf. speech on degree *Troilus and Cressida*  + Hamlet ) 

> Here me for my cause.

Opposition presented as differences of opinion that should not threaten the union of the country. Understanding strategy towards the South.

He takes up again slave owner's arguments ( humanitarian argument ) 

« And candor » cf. call at the end of declaration of independence 

### Second paragraph 

conciliatory stance to preserve the union

### Third paragraph 

secession as Elizabethan world picture  
events on earth are reflects of what happens in the sky 
feeling of national belonging 
rejection of anti-federalist point of view 
« concurrent agreement of all the members of this great republic to separate » = John Calhoun’s theory of concurrent majority 

## Outline 

**How Webster tries to avoid passing a judgement over slavery in order to preserve the Union and make it the first priority ?** 

**I ) A Whig point of view stressing the prevalence of the Senate**

**II) A conciliatory stance that does not morally condemn slavery and takes it as the result of historical facts in order to make conciliation possible**

**III) A defence of union through Shakespearean perspective associated with the defence of the values of the American revolution** 

**Conclusion** = not for very long… Civil War. But the purpose of the War was not about the abolition of slavery.
