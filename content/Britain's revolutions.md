## An annulment issue 

- **1520s** : Dynastic problem for Henry VIII who wanted an **annulment** ( ≠ divorce ) of his mariage with Catherine of Aragon. They only had one child because she struggled to infant ( ≠ « an heir and a spare » ). He needed extra legitimate children. But the pope said no for political reasons ( the King of Spain was against and threatened Vatican ). 
- **1534** : So he opted for a **schism** ( only on a administrative point of view ). The **Act of Supremacy** declared that the king was the « head of the Church <u>in</u> England ». But nothing was changed to the doctrine. **Hybrid of Protestantism and Catholicism**. They kept a very strict hierarchy. So an **half Reformation**. England leave the Catholic Church. 

## « No bishop, no king »

- <b>17<sup>th</sup></b> : Intertwined religious and political conflicts on the king’s power. James I said « **No bishop, no king** » = if you got rid of religious hierarchy the crown will be threatened. 
- James I (1603-25) = authoritarian + close to Catholics. 
- Charles I (1625-1649) = + authoritarian ( defending the « divine rights of kings » ) 

## English Civil War

- **1640s** : English Civil War 
- **1649** : Execution of Charles I and **abolition of the monarchy**. Creation of the **Commonwealth** regime → the Protectorate = military dictatorship led by CROMWELL. 
- **1658** : CROMWELL died 
- **1660** : Restoration of the Monarchy → Charles II = crypto Catholic authoritarian 

## The Glorious Revolution

- **1685** : Charles II dies and James II became king = Catholic & ++ authoritarian. He started to raise a catholic and authoritarian child ⇒ Parliament understood that waiting was useless. So they wrote to **William and Mary of Orange** = « would you like by any chance become king and queen ? ». James II fled.
- **1689** : Parliament imposed the Bill of Rights to their future king defining the rights of Parliament = **parliamentary monarchy**. 
- « **Glorious** » because gradual progress without violences → The Whig vision of history ! « **Revolution** » because illegal act to replace the king. 
- But they didn’t like the fact that it was a R° because how to legitimate the regime in front of another revolutions ? ⇒ we’re going to deny the Revolution. **Parliament rewrote the history** and describe the events in an Act as a **fiction of abdication**.
