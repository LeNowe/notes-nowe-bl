# Texte 2 - Washington’s *Farewell Address*, 1796
***
## Introduction 

- The first leaving address = a call for unity to support the federal constitution 
- No consensus on the constitution : Federalist Party V.S Democratic Republican Party
- **Using his personal legitimacy to strengthen the institutions** *i.e* Washington = God, « Father of the Country », out of political debates. 
- Lot of debates over presidential power fearing the threat of authoritarian power. 
- **1783** : **Newburgh Conspiracy** = generals went to Washington to asked him to be dictator. He refuses and went to the Congress to surrender his commission. He became the « **new Cincinnatus** ». 
- **1791** : the Capital city was named Washington = he embodied the nation. 
- He was not forced to leave but he knew that all everything he does would created a precedent for the next presidents. So he decided to leave before to avoid dying in power like kings and dictators. 
- **Issue at stake** : How a presidential regime could work without being led by saint Washington ? 

## <u>I. A united nation</u> 

### A ) A common interest 

- Risk of **sectionalism** ( = a geographical section defending its own interest ) from the North ( = trade + manufacturing ), the South ( = agriculture ), East ( = trade ), West ( = raw materials like pelts ). 
- **1760s-1770s** : The Regulators = working class squatters 
- But the diversity is re-envisaged to reveal complementary intercourses = an « **indissoluble community of interest** ». 
- **Anti-mercantilism** vision of trade. Indeed mercantilism : trade = a zero-sum game ⇒ potentially conflictual = economic policy within British empire. 

### B ) National independence 

- **« No foreign entanglement » policy** = **isolationism** because differences with European countries are a problem because they are political ones. 

> The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connexion as possible. 

- The **geographical distance** enables the United States to be a **utopia**. 

### C ) A common identity 

- « **One people** » / 13 states 
- Based on culture, religion and history = **a nation based on nurture and not ethnicity**. 
- Late 17<sup>th</sup> = settlement of French and German population in the colonies to generate more wealth in the colonies. 
- **Religious diversity** : Virginia ( = Church of England ), Massachussetts ( = Congregationalism founded by Puritans ), Rhode Island ( = freedom of religion ), Maryland ( = catholic ), Pennsylvania ( = Quakers ) but **homogenisation** 
- <u>Ex</u> : **Hector St John de CRÈVECOEUR** ( = lot of roots ! ), ***Letters from an American Farmer*, 1782** describes the rise of syncretism = fictional text *i.e* series of letters from the sender who claims to be an american farmer writing for a European public. He constantly stresses how America is better and 100% different from Europe but also is a loyalist during the war of independence. 
- The end of the war ⇒ **disestablishment of most state established religion** except Connecticut as late as **1818** ⚠ seems in contradiction with the 1st amendment of the *Bill of Rights* ( = protect individual rights from the federal state ). But progressive « **incorporation of the Bill of rights** » ( *i.e* also protecting from the local states, 1920s ). 

## <u>II. The need for political consolidation</u>

- **Consolidation** ( in America’s politics ) = strengthen federal power at the expense of the states and most of the case especially the executive branch ( <u>Ex</u> : in the *Federalist papers* ). 
### A ) A truly Republican constitution 

- **Strong common government** = efficiency to facilitate trade and to resist European powers. 
- Facing **anti-federalists criticisms** ( pre 1789 ) : 
	1. **The convention did not have a mandate** to draft a Constitution. The delegates just had to amend the *Articles of Confederation* ⇒ Confederation ( = each member retains its sovereignty ) ≠ Federal government ( = some sovereignty is given to the federal government ). WASHINGTON argued that the Constitution was « adopted by the people » = ***ex-post* ratification**. 
	2. **Not debated public**. WASHINGTON argued that after it was enact ***ex-post* debates**. <u>Ex</u> : *The Federalist papers*. 
	3. **Risk of an authoritarian power**. WASHINGTON defended « **distribution of power**s » *i.e* checks and balances ( ⇒**incomplete separation of powers**  <u>Ex</u> : President’s power of veto  ). 
	4. **No *Bill of Rights* !** = deliberate choice. But they thought the Fed gov would unlikely encroach on liberties because it would be virtuous = MADISON’s **theory of the representative filter** = community will benefit from an minority educated elite. WASHINGTON also argued that the Constitution included a process to amend it.  

### B ) Reconciling liberty and strong government 

- « your Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty » ⇒ becoming widely accepted but hen war was won : tentation to abandon AoC considered as only intended to fight UK 
- **1785** : Mount Vernon ( = W’s home ) Conference to solve a conflict between Maryland & Virginia
- **1786** : **Annapolis Conference** ⇒ 5 states out of 13 sent delagates… 
- **1786** : End of the War → large debt especially in Massachusetts. The rich refused inflation  and the working class refused taxation. The governor chose taxation ⇒ **SHAYS’s Rebellion**  = rebellion of poor farmers. Massachusetts militia could’t stop it so the upper class provided its own militia. When the government is too weak, power is the hand of the rich = threat for the Republic. 
- **1787** : **Philadelphia Conference** 
- **1794** : The **Whiskey Rebellion** = rebellion of poor farmers objecting on a tax on whiskey in Pennsylvania. W went in the state at head of a federal army ⇒ they stopped. 

### C ) Stabilising and strengthening existing institutions 

- In favor ***status quo*** = emphasis on the **duty to obey the government** 
- Discouraging even legal modifications of the Constitution = inspired by W’s war-time experience.

## <u>III. </u> 

### A ) The dangers of partisanship

- « baneful effects of the spirit of party » 
- **No concept of legitimate opposition to a Republican** ( = represents the common good ) **government** ⇒ « party » or the concept of party is absent of the constitution 
- A party → « **artifices** » and « **misrepresentation** »
-  « If I could not go to heaven without a party, I would not go there at all » T. JEFFERSON
- The alternate domination of one faction over another ⇒ **instability** ⇒ population will favour stability through authoritarian government ( the reference is the Roman Empire ). 

### B ) Washington’s own partisan agenda

- Tensions persisted on the interpretation of the Constitution and the gov’s priorities. 

|                | Antifed/DemRep                      | Fed<sup>sts</sup>                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Main figure    | JEFFERSON                           | HAMILTON                                |
| Threat         | Domestic = fear of a big government | Foreign = invasion by European Empire   |
| Priority       | Defence of individual liberties     | Strong national institutions/army       |
| Social model   | Egalitarian                         | Accept a moneyed elite that will invest |
| Economic model | Yeoman farmers                      | Industry, finance and trade             |
| Foreign policy | France ( republican ideology )      | Britain ( commercial power )            |
| Federalism     | Prioritise states                   | Strengthen national government          |
| Exegesis               |  « Strict constructionism » = default setting *i.e* if Constitution is silent then power to the states. 10th Amendment ≈ victory of strict constructionism !                           |  « Loose constructionism » & theory of « implied powers »                                  |

**⇒ Conflicts between Fed and DemRep = the end of the dream of a non-partisan election**  
- **1790** : **assumption of war debts** claimed by Secr. to Treasury A. HAMILTON = « let’s nationalise the debts ». Why ? To **align interests of the rich lenders with the survival of the federal government** + extensive powers of taxation. Antifed said « ok » but the capitale has to be next to Virginia. 
- **1791** : Same problem with the creation ( or not ) of the 1st Bank of the US. Lack of a trusted currency ⇒ barter. So according to the Fed the government should create a National Bank that would emit a national currency. Two arguments : align US rich’s interest on the survival of the government & finance « **public improvement** ». 
- **1794** : The Whiskey Rebellion 
- **1794** : **Jay’s Treaty** → official « neutrality » ( but in practice = policy closer to Britain )

In 1790 = attempt of a non-partisan administration 
- Pdt = GW ( neutral ) 
- Vice-pdt = J. ADAMS ( fed )
- Secretary of State = T. JEFFERSON ( anti-fed )
- Secretary to the Treasury = A.HAMILTON ( fed )

But during GW’ presidency political decisions became increasingly in favour of the Federalist ( national bank, Jay’s treaty ) ⇒ **1793** : T. JEFFERSON resigned and started to organise the opposition. The Fed and the RepDem perceived themselves as the only representation of the nation and considered the other as a dangerous party. 

### C ) Nation building 

> The unity of Government, which constitutes you one people, is also now dear to you. 

- GW suggest that **the creation of a State will generate the feeling of a common and national identity**. State first ! 
- **1983** : **Benedict ANDERSON, *Imagined Communities*** = total classic. Nation are « imagined communities » not objective characteristics. Belonging to a nation is binary but identities form a continuum. So necessity to establish arbitrary limits between the nations. To create a national identity by focusing on foils ( here GW describing Europe as an anti-model ) = exclusion. 
- GW tries to transfer his personal legitimacy to the Federalist party. But failure in the medium-term → **1800** : T. JEFFERSON became Pdt = « **the Revolution of 1800** » according to him ( = claiming that under GW and ADAMS the Republic was corrupted ).  
- Confirming GW failure = **12th amendment of 1804** ( = « presidential ticket » ) = **acceptance of the inevitability of party rule**. 




***
- raw materials 
- irreconcilable 
- to outline 
- to underpin stg = sous-tendre quelque chose
- to level a criticism 
- **1651** : **First Navigation Act** clarifying. American trade had to be made by British ships and british crews. It had to go to Britain to pay a duty and then to its destination ⇒ made to enrich the mother country or to strengthen military power increasing the demand of ships and sailors. 
- JEFFERSON on Revolution = « The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time »
- to do one’s utmost = faire de son mieux
