# Friedrich Hayek, *The Road to Serfdom*, 1944
***
- cf. [[Article sur la pensée de Hayek.pdf]] 
- We **usually think of HAYEK as a dominant figure** (because inspired the New Right) = *The Road to Serfdom* = **THATCHER’s bedside book** 
- But in the **1930s** he was a lecturer at the LSE during the 1940s (but not ideologically friendly at that time) ⇒ the **general atmosphere in Britain was not ideologically friendly for HAYEK** (Great Depression ⇒ fail of the market)
- **1931** : **UK left the GES ⇒ £ area ≈ imperial preference** 
- **1940s** : **socialist calculation debate** = the economy can be seen as a system that processes information and that adjust supply and demand 
	- **HAYEK : decentralised calculation  (imperfect information)**
	- **Socialists : national planning (complexity)**
- **Intellectual debate on the rise of nazi Germany** : 
	- Left-wing intelligentsia (from LSE) stressed that the nazi regime was persecuting communist ⇒ **it is the opposite with communism and can be associated with capitalism** (German capitalists tolerated HITLER) <u>Ex</u> : what BEVERIDGE thought 
	- HAYEK lay a stress on the « socialism » in « national-socialism » ⇒ **nazi Germany = natural evolution of socialism** 
- **1938** : Harold MACMILLAN, young Conservative, published *The Middle way* ⇒ Britain should developed a mixed economy (public ownership + market) = **rising consensus**
- **1942** : **BEVERIDGE report** = how to reconstruct UK after victory ⇒ advocated for state intervention in the economy (**perceived by HAYEK as the start of the socialisation of the British economy** ⇒ **totalitarian country**)
- **1944** : ***The Road to Serfdom*** ≠ book dedicated to economist but a political tract destined to the general public, simple message = **you couldn’t have planning and democracy at the same time** (he did not managed to discredit socialist ideas cf. Postwar consensus). 

**Problematic = why a so logical argument failed to convince the public ?**
## <u>I. Situation : the shift toward planning</u>

### A ) Britain’s new generation 

- « **Our generation** » ⇒ rupture with past consensus (generation that became adult after WWI) 
- **WWI** ⇒ **decline of the « deference society »** (= society in which people who are at the bottom of the social order automatically trust the people at the top to make the right decision) – ⚠ problematic movement (Chartism existed !) – **because of conscription** ⇒ class barriers became eroded + consensus that presented the British army as a « **lions led by donkeys** »
- **1918** : all men got the vote (+ women >30) ⇒ **class is no longer a discriminator** 
- During the interwar period, **people thought that WWI ended the Victorian period** (only perception, historians think that **the People’s budget already marked a clear departure with Victorian ideas**)
### B ) The challenge to laissez-faire 

- Limited government intervention was now associated with a period of crisis ⇒ consensus among the population that the free market was not working ⇒ the **Great Depression evidenced that the market was not working** (under-consumption and surproduction). 
- Left-wing economists explained that the rise of monopoly was inevitable in free markets = **inevitable trend towards monopolies** (economies of scale) ⇒ **nationalisation of natural monopolies** (Fabians went to URSS and declared that its economy was very well regulated <u>Ex</u> : Sidney and Beatrice WEBB, *Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation ?* ⇒ they removed the « ? » for the second edition !). 
- **WWII gave arguments in favour of planning** 
	- Government ⇒ controls production 
	- Rationalising = controls consumption 

### C ) « The end of economic man »

- **↘ homo œconomicus’ vision of the world** 
- « The claims for social reconstruction » = **BEVERIDGE’s ideas** (compulsory insurance + « f**rom the cradle to the grave** »)

**⇒ Peter DRUCKER, *The end of economic man*, 1939**
- WWI + Great Depression eroded the trust of the public in K<sup>ism</sup> 
- Socialism (in URSS) ≠ credible alternative (because also class society in URSS)
- Westerns population = tempted by irrational/non-materialistic platform 

**Indeed, some aspects of BEVERIDGE's reports = less-materialistic** 
- **« 5 giants » → John BUNYAN, *The Pilgrim’s Progress*, 1678 (= christian best-seller in the UK)** ⇒ much more than economic project but will to create **social harmony** = moral project = end of the economic man 

## <u>II. Hayek’s statement : the socialist fantasy is a nightmare</u>

### A ) The problem of complexity 

- Planning would run into an impossible problem = **problem of complexity** 
- **People don’t understand that the economy is efficient because it is complex** = increasing effects of the division of labour ⇒ **each individuals are part of complex networks** 
- And **high complexity is good** ! A simpler economy could not produce all the goods associated with modern civilisations and its living standards 
- **High complexity but no capitalism ⇒ submission to an uncontrollable planner** 
	- Even the planner could’t understand all about the economy 
	- That planner could never explain his decisions to the whole of the work force 

### B ) Impatient consumers 

- People will not like to not understand the planner’s decisions but are obsessed by the **desire to consume more ⇒ the new generation will refuse any concession on their material welfare** 
- **People are not supporting socialism as political and moral project but because they expect that it will enable them to consume more** 
	- In a market economy, dissatisfied people can’t blame someone precisely 
	- In a planned economy, they will turn against the planner but he can’t explain to everyone ! 
- **Impossible trinity between** : 
	- A complex economy (high living standards)
	- A planned economy 
	- Democracy 
- So **what socialists presented as a utopia is in fact a dystopia** ! 
	- To defeat idleness ⇒ you can move a coal worker in the North in the car industry in the South = lot of power to the State ! 
	- To defeat squalor ⇒ creation of social houses = government decides where and in what sort of homes people will live = lot of power of the State ! 
## <u>III. Why Hayek’s agreement fell on deaf ears ?</u>

### A ) One expert’s word 

[…] demander à Antoine 

Like BURKE Friedrich HAYEK states that things are too complex for people ⇒ market ≈ religion. But he makes big claims and expect people to only accept his explains. But in 1940s there were other experts saying the opposite of HAYEK (indeed for early ½ a century with Fabians). 

### B ) An abstract argument 

It’s democracy or the goulag… **At no point he envisages positions of compromise (a mixed economy)**. His claims are based on **the idea that man has only selfish and material interests** (black market during WWII). **Very poor vision of man**. But he forgets ∃ solidarity (evacuation of children from the cities to the country side after Luftwaffe’s bombings ⇒ geographical and class mixing).  

HAYEK is talking to a generation that had experienced WWI , the Great Depression and WWII. And **the only thing he was offering was to come back to the situation before WWI. BEVERIDGE was offering  a new and better world**. 

**CHURCHILL’s « Gestapo Speech »** : if Britain voted for Labour it would entail the creation of a kind of Gestapo (≈ HAYEK’s argument) = **catastrophic reception**. CHURCHILL **was fired by the electorate in 1945**. 

But HAYEK was right on some points : **when people are tempted by socialism ≠ on a ideological basis. For the average voter = « bread and butter question »**. It was well evidenced by the 1970s with THATCHER’s victory.
