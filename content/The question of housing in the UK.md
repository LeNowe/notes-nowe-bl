# The question of housing in the UK
***
**Growing trend of real estate prices since 2000s** everywhere (and faster in the most dynamic areas in North West and South East). Different impact than in the [[The question of housing in the US|US]] = shift in the historic trend of the proportion of owner-occupier = **decline of the owner-occupier share of the population** = experienced as a disaster : **young people can’t access to property and spend more money in housing than their parents did**  (that’s a problem because their generation have tuition fees !). To get your house you have to accept a bigger debt (and longer !). 

Why prices are getting higher ? Same as in the US + extra factor playing in Britain : **urban areas can’t expand because of England’s « green belts »** (around London, Birmingham, Manchester, Oxford = 13% of England) = to allow urban people to allow a weekend in the countryside ! **Britain remained strangely attached to a fantasised rural identity** <u>Ex</u> : William BLAKE, *Jerusalem*, 1804 = « England’s green and pleasant Lands » v.s « the dark satanic Mills [factories]» (cf. Labour Party platform cover in 2010) ⇒ the only way is to inside the population density inside the green belts ⇒ taller buildings but ≠ option because **cultural suspicion of living in a flat + problem of nimbyism** (impossible to build high buildings outside the city center of London) ⇒ vast influence of nimbyism (because they are old people and they vote a lot) ⇒ **continuous increase of prices** ⇒ the only way to limit the phenomenon = state’s intervention on real estate market = social housing. 
- **1918-1980s** : ↗ of the % of social housing (⅓) 
- **THATCHER privatised social housing** (biggest under her) = **the « Right to buy » policy** (keeping the same people in the same houses but sitting tenants were incited to buy it) ⇒ Aim : British citizens → property owners ⇒ less dependent on the State + safer financially + ideological desire to limit the place of the public sector in the economy + electoral agenda (if you turn tenants into owners they will become conservatives, thought THATCHER) 
- Criticism : the poorest couldn’t buy their house, some bought to sell back to property develops, the central government imposed the decision on local councils ⇒ shrink the stock of available social housing ⇒ ↗ prices 
- **1980s-2022** : ↘ social housing (⅕), no turning point even after THATCHER ⇒ the policy became the norm even for Labour governments 

Why there is **much in THATCHER’s legacy that Tony BLAIR did not reverse** : 
- **Tactical/electoral pragmatism** = avoid repeating 1980s when Old Labour = « **Loony left** » (the old platform was considered as absurd) <u>Ex</u> : before 1997’s election BLAIR promised to keep the budget passed by the Conservatives (to appear credible). 
- **Sincere faith in free market** = New Labour and **Third Way** considered that the market was more efficient to create growth and then that the state should increase taxes on this growth in order to increase public services. 

**Current property policy** : **help individuals but increase prices**  
- Cheap loans to first-time buyers (« get a foothold on the property ladder »)
- Got subsidies for tenants in the private sector 

**Another solution = create jobs and attractiveness in areas where the prices are lower** <u>Ex</u> : « levelling up » (Boris JONHSON), HS2 = high speed trains connecting the North better with the South. But **the project has been cancelled**.
